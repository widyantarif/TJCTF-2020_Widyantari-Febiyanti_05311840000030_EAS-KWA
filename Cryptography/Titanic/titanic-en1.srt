13 meters. You should see it.

3
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,725
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

4
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,523
<i>Mir 2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.</i>

5
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,721
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

6
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,521
Seeing her coming out of the
darkness like a ghost ship...

7
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,436
..,still gets me every time.

8
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,029
To see the sad ruin of the
great ship sitting here...

9
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,694
...where she landed at
2:30 in the morning

10
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,900
Of April 15, 1912..

11
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,532
---After her long fall---

12
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,322
...from the world above.

13
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,412
You are so full of shit, boss.

14
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,613
Dive 6. Here we are again
on the deck of Titanic.

15
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,913
2% miles down
3,821 meters-

16
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,244
The pressure outside is 3% tons per square inch

17
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,750
These windows are
9 inches thick.

18
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,671
If they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds.

19
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,631
All right, enough of that bullshit.

20
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,983
Just put her down on the roof of
the officers' quarters like yesterday

21
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,944
<i>Mir 2, we're landing right over the
Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch?</i>

22
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,701
Yeah, Brock. Launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

23
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,631
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

24
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,503
<i>Okay, Brock, we're dropping
down along the hull.</i>

25
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,134
Yeah, roger that- Okay, drop down and go
into the first class gangway door-

26
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,060
I want you guys working the D deck...

Tether out. Okay, now left. Left, left.
Okay, coming left.

30

<i>Snoop Dog is on the move.

Okay Lewis, drop down to B deck.

32
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,136
- Okay, A deck-
- Give me some rope, Captain

33
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,963
B deck. Get in there. Get in there.

34
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,594
Watch the door frame.

35
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,430
- Watch it, watch ii.
- I see it. I got it.

36
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,854
- We good? Bring her down.
- We're good. Just chill, boss.

37
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,450
Okay, make your turn

38
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,199
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

39
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,834
Yeah Brock, we're at the piano.
You copy?

40
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,954
<i>Okay, copy that.</i>

00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,555
Okay, right there. Right there.

42
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,340
Okay, that's it, that's it.
That's the bedroom door.

43
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,933
I see it. I see ii.

44
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,109
We're in!

45
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,525
We're in, baby. We're there.

46
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,698
That's Hockley's bed.

47
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,818
That's where the
son of a bitch slept.

48
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,330
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

49
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,083
Hold it. Hold it just a second.
Go back to the right.

50
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,008
That wardrobe door
Get closer.

51
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,764
You smelling something, boss'?

52
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,180
- I want to see what's under it.
- Give me my hands, man.

53
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,191
All right.

54
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,774
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

55
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,446
Go, go, go. Flip it over.
Flip it over. Go.

56
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,401
Tum her over. Keep going.

57
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,779
<i>Go, go, 9°-</i>

58
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,204
Okay, drop it.

59

Oh, baby, baby.
Are you seeing this, boss?

60
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,463
It's payday, boys.

61
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,944
Cha-ching!

62
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,658
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back, Baby.

63
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,988
Oh, yeah! Who's the best'?
\Nho's the best, baby?

64
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,322
Say it. Say it. Say it.

65
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,329
You are, Lewis.

66
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,911
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

67
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,838
Okay, crack her open.

68
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,952
Shit.

69
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,707
No diamond.

70
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,471
You know boss, this same thing happened
to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

71
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,892
Turn the camera off.

72
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,721
Brock, the partners would like
to know how it's going.

73
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:01,227
Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't
in the safe. But hey, hey...

74
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,063
...Don't worry about it. There's still
plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.

75
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,861
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room-U

76
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,949
the purser's safe on C deck.

77
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,326
Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

78
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:15,415
A dozen other places- Guys, look, you're just
going to have to trust my instincts- I know we're close

79
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,001
We've just got to go through a little
process of elimination.

80
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,083
Hang on a second.

81
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,001
- Let me see that.
- Ah, we may have something here, guys.

82
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,597
Where's the photograph
of the necklace?

83
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,590
We'll call you right back.

84
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,445
I'll be goddamned.

There's a satellite call for you.

00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,948
Bobby, we're launching. You see
these submersibles going in the water'?

111
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,613
Trust me, buddy.
You want to take this call.

112
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,787
This better be good.

113
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,786
Now, you gotta speak up.
She's kind of old.

114
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,204
Great.

115
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,454
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...?

116
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,832
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

117
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,832
Mrs. Calvert.

118
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,799
I was just wondering if you had found...

119
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,047
...the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovell.

120
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,135
Told you you wanted to take the call.

121
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,391
All right, you have my
attention, Rose.

122
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,976
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is'?

123
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,738
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

124
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:12,338
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

125
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,425
God only knows why.
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

126
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,597
They're inbound!

127
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,519
Rose DeV\fitt Bukater died on the
Titanic when she was 17, right?

128
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,277
- That's right.
- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

129
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,775
101 next month.

130
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,949
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

131
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,364
Look, I've already done the
background on this woman...

132
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,456
...all the way back to the 20s,
when she was working as an actress.

133
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,625
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

134
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:51,252
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

135
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,801
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

136
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,300
Now Calvert's dead
and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.

137
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,890
And everybody who knows about the
diamond is supposed to be dead...

138
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,092
...or on this boat,
but she knows.

139
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,075
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

140
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,489
Hurry up, give him a hand.

141
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,910
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovell.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

142
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,001
Okay, let's get her inside there.

143
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,495
Hi, Miss Calvert.

144
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,755
- Hi.
- Welcome to the Keldysh.

145
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,841
Thanks.

146
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,502
Hey!

147
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,178
Are your staterooms
all right'?

148
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,304
Oh, yes.

149
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,351
Very nice.

150
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,725
Have you met my
granddaughter, Lizzy?

151
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,317
She takes care of me.

152
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,441
We met just a few
minutes ago.

153
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,654
Remember, Nana'?
Up on deck?

154
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,031
Oh, yes.

155
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,613
There. That's nice.

156
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,699
Have to have my
pictures when I travel.

157
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,787
Can I get you anything?

158
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,032
Is there anything you'd like?

159
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,788
Yes.

160
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,628
I would like to
see my drawing.

161
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,391
Louis XVI wore a fabulous
stone that was...

162
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,188
...called the Blue Diamond
of the Crown...

163
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,146
...which disappeared
in 1792...

164
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,067
...about the same time old Louis lost
everything from the neck up.

165
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,150
The theory goes that the
crown diamond was chopped, too.

166
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,657
Recut into a heart-like shape that
became known as---

167
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,863
...the Heart of the Ocean.

168
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,745
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope diamond.

169
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,164
It was a dreadful,
heavy thing.

170
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,495
I only wore it this once.

171
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,089
You actually think
this is you, Nana?

172
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,208
It is me, dear.

173
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,211
Wasn't I a dish'?

174
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,928
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

175
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,929
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

176
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,686
Can you tell me who the
claimant was, Rose?

177
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,609
I should imagine someone
named Hockley.

178
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,645
Nathan Hockley,
that's right.

179
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,113
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

180
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,824
The claim was for a
diamond necklace his son...

181
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,284
...Caledon, bought his fiancée.

182
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,694
You.

183
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,364
A week before he
sailed on Titanic.

184
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,708
And it was filed right
after the sinking.

185
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,629
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

186
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,211
You see the date?

187
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,710
April14, 1912.

188
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,888
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is...

189
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,804
...she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

190
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,179
And that makes you
my new best friend.

191
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,182
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

192
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,569
This was mine.

193
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,902
How extraordinary.

194
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,990
And it looks the same as ii
did the last time I saw it.

195
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,244
The reﬂection has
changed a bit.

196
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,434
Are you ready to go
back to Titanic?

197
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,192
Okay, here we go.

198
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,567
She hits the berg on
the starboard side, right?

199
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,655
She kind of bumps along...

200
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,899
...punching holes like
morse code...

201
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,525
-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...

202
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,617
...below the waterline.

203
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,284
Then the fonuard compartments
start to flood.

204
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,782
Now, as the water
level rises...

205
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,658
...it spills over the
watertight bulkheads...

206
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,710
...which, unfortunately, don't go
any higher than E deck.

207
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,376
So now as the
bow goes down...

208
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,215
...the stern rises up,
slow at first...

209
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,800
...then faster and faster...

210
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,299
...until finally, she's got her whole
ass sticking up in the air.

211
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,343
And that's a big ass.

212
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,300
We're talking
20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

213
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,723
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure-

214
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,437
So, what happens?

215
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,685
She splits, right
down to the keel.

216
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,682
And the stern...

217
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,233
...falls back level.

218
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,317
Then...

219
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,402
...as the bow sinks...

220
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,396
...it pulls the stern vertical...

221
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,569
..,and then finally detaches.

222
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,661
Now the stern section just kind of bobs
there like a cork for a couple of minutes...

223
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,076
...floods, and finally goes
under about 2:20 AM...

224
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,496
-..2 hours and 40 minutes
after the collision-

225
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,336
The bow section
planes <i>away...</i>

226
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,294
...landing about a
half a mile away...

227
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,375
-..going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor-

228
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,263
Pretty cool, huh?

229
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,851
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

230
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,022
Of course, the
experience of it was...

231
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,521
...somewhat different.

232
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,019
V\fill you share it with us?

233
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,075
I'm taking her to rest

234
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,167
No.

235
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,502
Come on, Nana.

236
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,837
No!

237
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,589
Give me the
tape recorder.

238
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,759
Tell us, Rose.

239
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,930
It's been 84 years--

240
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,228
It's okay. Just try
to remember anything...

241
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,642
...anything at all.

242
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,608
Do you want to hearthis
or not, Mr. Lovell?

243
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,608
It's been 84 years...

244
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,447
...and I can still smell
the fresh paint.

245
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,083
The china had
never been used.

246
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,458
The sheets had
never been slept in.

247
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:52,047
Titanic was called
the ship of dreams.

248
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,716
And it was.

249
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,681
It really was.

250
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,414
All third-class
passengers...

251
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,753
...with a forward berth...

252
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,047
...this way please!
This queue!

253
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,087
It's a big boat, huh'?

254
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,431
Daddy, it's a ship.

255
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,423
You're right.

256
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,421
I don't see what all
the fuss is about.

257
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,041
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

258
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,134
You can be blasé
about some things, Rose...

259
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,878
...but not about Titanic.

260
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,926
It's over 100 feet longer
than Mauretania...

261
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,469
...and far more luxurious.

262
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,768
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

263
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,097
So this is the ship they
say is unsinkable.

264
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,223
It is unsinkable.

265
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,725
God Himself
could not sink this ship--

266
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,850
What?!

267
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,444
You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

268
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,652
It's round that
way, sir.

269
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,564
I put my faith in
you good sir.

270
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:37,690
Now kindly
see my man

271
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,115
Yes sir. It's my
pleasure, sir.

272
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,234
If I can do
anything at all...

273
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,577
Yes, right.

274
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,904
All the trunks from
that car there.

275
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,952
12 from here.

276
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,164
And the safe,
to the parlor suite...

277
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,911
...rooms B-52, 54, 56.

278
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,248
Ladies...

279
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,083
...we better hurry.

280
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,376
Come along.

281
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,133
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

282
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:10,561
All third -class passengers
queue here for health inspection

283
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,232
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

284
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,614
<i>It was the ship of dreams...</i>

285
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,987
<i>...to everyone else.</i>

286
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,281
<i>To me, it was a
slave ship...</i>

287
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,789
<i>...taking me back to
America in chains.</i>

288
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,790
<i>Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.</i>

289
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,626
<i>Inside, I was screaming.</i>

290
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,485
Jack, you are pazzo.

291
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,320
You bet everything
we have.

292
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,649
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

293
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,120
Sven?

294
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,189
All rig ht,
moment of truth.

295
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,688
Someone's life is
about to change.

296
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,064
Fabrizio'?

297
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,524
<i>Niente.</i>

298
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:44,692
Olaf?

299
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,865
Nothing.

300
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,366
Sven?

301
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,872
Uh-oh.
2 pair.

302
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,124
I'm sorry,
Fabrizio.

303
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,505
I'm sorry...

304
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,670
...you're not gonna see
your mom again for a...

305
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,798
...long time...

306
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,466
...'cause we're
going to America.

307
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,845
Full house, boys!

308
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,232
Come on.

309
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,739
I'm going home!

310
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,277
I'm going home.

311
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,620
I go to America!

312
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,246
No, mate.

313
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,574
Titanic go to America,

314
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,076
in 5 minutes.

315
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:36,702
Shit. Fabri.
Come on.

316
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,749
Come on,
here. Here.

317
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,962
We're riding in
high style now!

318
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,673
We're a couple of
regular swells.

319
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,386
We're practically
goddamn royalty...

320
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,379
<i>...ragazzo mio.</i>

321
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,590
You see'?
ls my destine.

322
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,221
Like I told you...

323
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,968
I go to America to
be millionaire.

324
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,515
You are pazzo.

325
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,187
Maybe, but I've
got the tickets.

326
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,611
Come on, I thought
you were fast.

327
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,604
<i>Aspetra!</i>

328
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,690
Whoa. Wait! Wait!

329
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,690
Hey. wait!

330
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,233
We're passengers!

331
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,488
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

332
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,580
Of oourse.

333
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,165
Anyway, we
don't have any lice.

334
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,125
We're Americans.
Both of us.

335
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,209
Right.

336
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,203
Come aboard.

337
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,175
We're the luckiest sons
of bitches in the world.

338
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,168
You know that?

339
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,394
Good-bye!

340
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,558
You know somebody'?

341
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,060
Of course not.
That's not the point.

342
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,653
Good-bye!
I'll miss you!

343
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,104
Good-bye!

344
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,281
I will never forget you!

345
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,498
Come with me,
darling. Let's go.

346
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,377
G-60.

347
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,043
G-60. G-60.

348
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,464
<i>Excuse me,
ma'am.</i>

349
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,717
G-60.

350
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,716
Oh, right here.

351
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,304
Hey, how you doing?

352
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,428
Jack. Nice
to meet you.

353
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,218
Jack Dawson.
Nice to meet you.

354
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,677
How you doing'?

355
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,730
Who says you get
top bunk, huh?

356
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,605
This is your private
promenade deck, sir.

357
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,858
V\fill you be requiring
anything?

358
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,408
Excuse me.

359
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,490
- This one'?
- No.

360
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,989
It had a lot of faces on ii.

361
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,907
This is the one.

362
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,418
Would you like all of
them out, miss?

363
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:26,918
Yes. We need a little
color in this room.

364
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,964
Put in there.
In the wardrobe.

365
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,173
God, not those finger
paintings again.

366
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,844
They certainly were a
waste of money.

367
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,013
The difference between
Cal's taste in art...

368
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,682
...and mine is that I have some.

369
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,678
They're fascinating.

370
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,186
Like being inside a dream
or something.

371
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,775
There's truth but no logic.

372
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,861
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

373
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,400
Something Picasso.

374
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,239
He won't amount
in a thing.

375
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,484
He won't, trust me.

376
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,028
- Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

377
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,621
Put it in the wardrobe.

378
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:09,464
<i>At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.</i>

379
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,463
<i>We all called her Molly.</i>

380
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,966
<i>History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.</i>

381
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,548
Well, I wasn't about to
wait all day for you, sonny.

382
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,675
Here, if you think
you can manage.

383
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,304
<i>Her husband had struck gold
someplace out west.</i>

384
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,436
<i>And she was what Mother
called "new money.</i> "

385
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,018
<i>By the next afternoon.--</i>

386
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,736
...we were steaming west
from the coast of Ireland...

387
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,108
<i>...with nothing out ahead
of us but ocean.</i>

388
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,495
Take he-r to sea,
Mr. Murdoch-

389
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,626
Let's stretch her legs.

390
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,078
Yes sir.

391
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,377
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

392
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,171
Very good, sir.

393
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,756
All ahead full.

394
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,887
All ahead full!

395
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,935
Come on lads,
step lively!

396
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,574
All right! Let's stoke
her right up!

397
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,998
We go full ahead!

398
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,327
Come on, put your
backs into it!

399
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,933
21 knots, sir.

400
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,851
Hey, look,
look, look!

401
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,448
See it'?

402
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,778
There's another
one! See him?

403
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,961
Look at that one!
Look at him jump!

404
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,820
I can see the Statue
of Liberty already.

405
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,575
Very small,
of course.

406
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,002
I'm the king
of the world!

407
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,044
<i>She is the largest moving object
ever made by the hand of man...</i>

408
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,295
...in all history.

409
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,848
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here...

410
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,716
...designed her from the
keel plates up.

411
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,094
I may have knocked
her together, but...

412
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,187
...the idea was
Mr. lsmay's.

413
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,107
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale...

414
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,224
...and so luxurious in...

415
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,351
...its appointments...

416
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,649
...that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

417
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,147
And here she is.

418
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,696
- V\Iilled into solid reality.
- Hear, hear.

419
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,406
I'll have the salmon.

420
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,908
You know I don't
like that, Rose.

421
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,754
She knows.

422
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,175
We'll both have
the lamb.

423
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,340
Rare, with very
little mint sauce.

424
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,013
You like lamb,
right sweet pea?

425
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,848
You gonna cut her meat
for her too there, Cal'?

426
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,273
Hey, who thought of
the name Titanic?

427
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,272
Was it you,
Bruce?

428
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,611
Yes, actually.

429
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,612
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability...

430
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,112
...luxury, and above
all, strength.

431
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,448
Do you know of
Dr. Freud, Mr. lsmay?

432
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:39,044
His ideas about the male preoccupation
with size might be of particular interest to you.

433
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,796
What's gotten into you'?

434
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,381
Excuse me.

435
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,304
I do apologize.

436
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,594
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

437
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:56,220
Well, I may have to start minding what she
reads from now on, won'! I, Mrs. Brown?

438
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,389
Freud? Who is he?
Is he a passenger'?

439
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,536
The ship is nice, huh'?

440
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,655
Yeah. It's an Irish ship.

441
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,781
Is English, no?

442
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,873
No, it was built
in Ireland-

443
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,868
15,000 lrishmen
built this ship.

444
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,542
Solid as a rock.
Big Irish hands.

445
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,330
That's typical.

446
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:27,380
First-class dogs
come down here to take a shile.

447
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,174
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

448
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,051
Like we could forget?

449
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,887
I'm Tommy Ryan.

450
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,223
- Jack Dawson.
- Fabrizio.

451
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,851
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

452
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,652
Ah, forget it, boyo.

453
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,075
You'd as like have angels fly out of
your arse as gel next lo...

454
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,573
...the likes of her.

455
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,934
<i>I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.</i>

456
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,770
<i>An endless parade
of parties and cotillions...</i>

457
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,106
<i>yachts and polo matches.</i>

458
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:36,449
<i>Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.</i>

459
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,791
<i>I felt like</i> I <i>was standing
at</i> a <i>great precipice--.</i>

460
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,625
<i>...with no one to pull me back.
No one who cared...</i>

461
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,127
...or even noticed.

462
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,692
Don't do ii.

463
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,078
Stay back.

464
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,072
Don't come any closer.

465
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:46,916
Come on.

466
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,330
Just give me your hand.
I'll pull you back over.

467
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,752
No!
Stay where you are.

468
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,080
I mean it.

469
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,420
I'll let go.

470
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,928
No, you won't.

471
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,272
What do you mean,
no I won't?

472
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,356
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

473
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,603
You don't know me.

474
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,775
Well, you would have done it already.

475
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,611
You're distracting me.
Go away.

476
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,284
I can't.

477
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,528
I'm involved now.

478
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,789
You let go, and I'm going to have
to jump in there after you.

479
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,118
Don't be absurd.

480
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,624
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

481
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,797
The fall alone will kill you.

482
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,297
It would hurt. I'm not
saying it wouldn't.

483
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,086
Tell you the truth...

484
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,215
...I'm a lot more concerned
about that water being so cold.

485
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,602
How cold?

486
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,147
Freezing.
Maybe a couple degrees over.

487
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,648
You ever, uh...

488
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,734
<i>...ever been
to Vwsconsin?</i>

489
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,159
What?

490
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,666
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

491
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,832
I grew up there,
near Chippewa Falls.

492
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,836
I remember when I was a kid,
me and my father, we went ice fishing...

493
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,008
...out on Lake Vwssota.

494
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,836
Ice fishing is, you know, where you--

495
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,762
I know what ice fishing is!

496
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,177
Sorry.

497
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:30,016
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

498
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,356
Anyway, I...

499
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,355
...fell through some thin ice.

500
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,194
And I'm telling you...

501
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,322
...water that cold,

502
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,191
like right down there...

503
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,328
...it hits you like 1000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

504
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,164
You can't breathe.

505
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,670
You can't think. Least not about
anything but the pain.

506
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,960
Which is why I'm not looking
forward to jumping in there afler you.

507
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,045
Like I said...

508
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,553
...I don't have a choice.

509
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,643
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll
come back over the rail and...

510
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,061
...and get me off
the hook here.

511
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,234
You're crazy.

512
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,733
That's what everybody says but...

513
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,983
...with all due respect, miss...

514
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,736
...I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

515
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,912
Come on.

516
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,244
Come on, give me your hand.

517
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,409
You don't want to do this.

518
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,927
I'm Jack Dawson.

519
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,101
Rose Dewitt Bu I-cater

520
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,106
I'll have to get you to
write that one down-

521
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,772
Come on.

522
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,066
<i>L</i> QOI you.

523
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,568
Come on.

524
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,286
Come on.

525
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,084
Help. please!

526
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,960
Help!

527
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,584
- Please, help me!
- Listen. Listen to me.

528
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,298
Listen. Listen to me.

529
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,963
I've got you.
I won't let go.

530
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,252
Now pull yourself up.
Come on!

531
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,298
Come on.

532
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,595
That's right.

533
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,225
You can do it.

534
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,482
<i>L</i> QOI you.

535
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,648
What's all this?

536
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,659
You stand back and...

537
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,410
...don't move an inch!

538
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,868
Fetch the Master at Arms.

539
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,169
This is completely unacceptable!

540
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,008
What made you think that you could
put your hands on my fiancée?!

541
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,840
Look at me, you filth!

542
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,342
Cal.

543
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,464
What do you think
you were doing?

544
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,175
Cal, stop.
It was an accident.

545
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,515
An accident?

546
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,187
It was.

547
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,352
Stupid, really.

548
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,685
I was leaning over and I slipped.

549
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:29,691
I was leaning far over
to see the, uh...

550
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,368
...uh, uh, the uh...

551
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,538
- Propellers'?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

552
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,537
And I would have gone
overboard but Mr. Dawson here...

553
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,040
...saved me. And almost
went over himself.

554
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,046
You wanted to see the...
She wanted to see the propellers.

555
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:47,546
Like I said, women and
machinery do not mix.

556
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,378
Was that the way of it'?

557
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,882
Yeah- Yeah, that
was pretty much it

558
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,718
Well, the boy's a hero then.

559
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,637
Good for you, son.
Well done.

560
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,888
So, it's all's well and back
to our brandy, eh?

561
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,903
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

562
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,906
Perhaps a little something
for the boy?

563
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,409
Of oourse.

564
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:17,243
Mr. Lovejoy,
I think a 20 should do it.

565
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,579
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

566
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,086
Rose is displeased.

567
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,252
What to do'?

568
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:27,707
I know.

569
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,592
Perhaps you could join us for
dinner tomorrow evening...

570
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,423
.,.to regale our group...

571
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,929
...with your heroic tale.

572
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,434
Sure.
Count me in.

573
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,107
Good.
It's settled then.

574
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,443
This should be interesting.

575
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,451
Can I bum a smoke'?

576
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,461
You'll want to tie those.

577
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,218
It's interesting...

578
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,546
...the young lady slipped
so suddenly...

579
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:19,134
...and you still had time to remove
yourjacket and your shoes.

580
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,318
I know you've been melancholy.

581
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,321
I don't pretend to know why.

582
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,163
I intended to save this...

583
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,336
...until the engagement
gala next week...

584
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,010
..,but, I thought...

585
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,678
...tonight.

586
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,346
Good gracious.

587
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:02,010
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

588
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,140
- Is it a--
- Diamond. Yes.

589
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,855
56 carats to be exact.

590
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,196
It was worn by Louis XVI.

591
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,366
And they called
it Le Coeur de Ia Mer.

592
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,701
- The Heart of the Ocean.
- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.

593
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,873
It's overwhelming.

594
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,000
Well, it's for royalty.

595
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,378
We are royalty, Rose.

596
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,722
You know, there's
nothing I couldn't give you

597
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,550
There's nothing I'd deny you...

598
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,390
..,if you would not deny me.

599
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,901
Open your heart to me, Rose.

600
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:11,288
Well, I've been on my own since
I was 15, since my folks died.

601
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:16,418
And I had no brothers or sisters or
close kin in that part of the country---

602
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:20,221
...so I lit on out of there and I
haven't been back since.

603
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,594
You could just call me a
tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

604
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:29,268
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck and...

605
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,559
...chewed over how great the weather's
been and how I grew <i>up...</i>

606
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,442
...but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

607
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,441
- Mr. Dawson, I--
- Jack.

608
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:42,860
Jack.

609
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,622
I want to thank you
for what you did.

610
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:51,290
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

611
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:52,962
You're welcome.

612
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,455
Look.

613
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,213
I know what you
must be thinking.

614
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,257
Poor little rich girl.

615
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,380
What does she know about misery'?

616
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,631
No.

617
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,805
No, that's not what I was thinking.

618
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,556
What I was thinking was...

619
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,977
---what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out'?

620
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,643
Well I...

621
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:20,444
It was everything.
It was my whole world and...

622
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,740
mall the people in it.

623
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,574
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead and me...

624
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,621
powerless to stop it

625
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,824
God,
look at that thing.

626
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,289
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

627
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,497
500 invitations have gone out.

628
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,505
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

629
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,794
And all the while I feel I'm...

630
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,171
-..standing in the middle
of a crowded room"-

631
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,969
...screaming at the
top of my lungs...

632
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,182
...and no one
even looks up.

633
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,010
Do you love him?

634
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,346
Pardon me'?

635
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,148
Do you love him?

636
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,686
You're being very rude. You
shouldn't be asking me this.

637
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,693
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

638
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:05,197
This is not a suitable conversation.

639
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,701
Why can't you just
answer the question?

640
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,331
This is absurd.

641
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,041
You don't know me
and I don't know you...

642
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,329
...and we are not having this
conversation at all. You are rude...

643
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,882
...and uncouth and presumptuous
and I am leaving now...

644
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,211
...Jack. Mr. Dawson.
It's been a pleasure.

645
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,962
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

646
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,173
And you've insulted me.

647
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,008
Well, you deserved it.

648
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,388
- Right.
- Right.

649
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,014
I thought you were leaving.

650
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,565
I am.

651
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,069
You are so annoying.

652
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,563
Wail.

653
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:47,068
I don't have to leave. This is
my part of the ship. You leave.

654
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,405
Well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?

655
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,085
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

656
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,589
So, what are you,
an artist or something?

657
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,595
These are rather good.

658
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:13,098
They're very good, actually.

659
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,107
Jack, this is exquisite work.

660
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,280
Ah, they didn't think too
much of them in old Paree.

661
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,615
Paris'?

662
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,574
You do get around
for a p--

663
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:36,079
Well, a-- a
person of limited means.

664
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,285
Go on. A poor guy, You can say it.

665
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,295
Well, well, well.

666
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,255
And these were drawn from life'?

667
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,802
Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.

668
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,724
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

669
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,646
You liked this woman.

670
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,652
You used her several times.

671
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:09,817
Well.

672
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,491
She had beautiful
hands, you see?

673
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,333
I think you must have
had a love affair with her.

674
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,827
No, no, no-
Just with her hands

675
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,834
She was a
one-legged prostitute.

676
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:24,957
See?

677
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,507
She had a good
sense of humor though.

678
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,011
Oh, and this lady...

679
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:42,020
She used to sit at this bar every night...

680
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,689
...wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned...

681
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,278
...just waiting for
her long, Inst love.

682
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,365
We called her Madame Bijoux.

683
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,700
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

684
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,204
Vhf ell,
you have a gift, Jack

685
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,873
You do.

686
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,700
You see people.

687
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,539
I see you.

688
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,297
And?

689
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,383
You wouldn't have jumped.

690
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:16,343
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

691
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,223
Rose has already done that.

692
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,396
Look, here comes that
vulgar Brown woman.

693
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,396
Quickly, get up before
she sits with us.

694
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,020
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.

695
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,901
We're awfully sorry,
you missed it.

696
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:33,322
The Countess and I were just
off to take the air on the boat deck.

697
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,574
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

698
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,246
Countess.

699
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,587
So, you've not yet lit the
last four boilers?

700
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,548
No, I don't see
the need.

701
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:49,421
We are making excellent time.

702
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:55,264
The press knows the size of Titanic.
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

703
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,766
We must give them
something new to print.

704
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,762
This maiden voyage
of Titanic must...

705
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,855
...make headlines.

706
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:08,103
Mr. lsmay, I would prefer
not to push the engines...

707
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,938
...until they've been properly run in.

708
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,615
Of course I'm just a passenger.

709
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,030
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

710
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,454
But what a glorious end to your final crossing...

711
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,039
...if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night...

712
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,789
---and surprise them all-
Make the morning papers

713
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,578
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

714
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,633
Good man.

715
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,546
After that, I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey...

716
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,466
...then I went to Los Angeles to the...

717
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,890
...Santa Monica pier
and did portraits for 10 cents each.

718
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,479
Why can't I be like you'?

719
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,309
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it-

720
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,063
Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...

721
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,486
...only if we just talk about it.

722
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,660
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.

723
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,660
Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up.

724
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,163
We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.

725
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:09,497
But you have to do it like a real cowboy.
No sidesaddle stuff.

726
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,671
You mean with one leg on each side'?

727
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,002
Can you show me'?

728
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,095
Sure, if you like.

729
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,345
Teach me to ride like a man.

730
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:21,934
Chew tobacco like a man.

731
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,683
And spit like a man.

732
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,765
You didn't learn in finishing school?

733
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,187
No.

734
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,359
Come on, I'll show you.

735
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,353
I'll show you how.

736
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,528
Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.

737
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,860
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

738
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,867
Watch closely.

739
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,532
That's disgusting.

740
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,533
Your turn

741
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,873
That was pitiful.
You really have to hawk it back.

742
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,210
Get some leverage.
Use your arms. Arc your neck.

743
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,545
You see the range on that thing?

744
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,551
Okay, go.

745
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:09,057
That was better. You have to work on ii.
Really try to hawk it up.

746
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,323
Mother.

747
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,081
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

748
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,084
Charmed, I'm sure.

749
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:38,423
<i>The others were gracious and curious
about the man who'd saved my life.</i>

750
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,590
<i>But my mother looked at him like an insect.</i>

751
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:47,095
<i>A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.</i>

752
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:51,273
Sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

753
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:58,944
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

754
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,946
Shall we go dress, Mother'?

755
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,785
See you at dinner, Jack.

756
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,780
Uh, son'?

757
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,453
Son!

758
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,293
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

759
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,287
Not really.

760
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,123
You're about to go into the snake pit

761
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,215
What are you going to weal'?

762
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,299
I figured. Come on.

763
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:32,314
I was right. You and my son
are just about the same size.

764
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,312
Pretty close.

765
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,322
You shine up like a new penny.

766
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,832
Good evening, sir.

767
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,894
Thousands of tons of Hockley steel
are in this ship.

768
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,238
- Which part?
- All the right ones.

769
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,654
Then you're accountable
if there's a problem. VVhere's Rose?

770
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,243
She'll be along.

771
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,570
There is the Countess.

772
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:42,937
I saw that in a nickelodeon
and always wanted to do it.

773
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,539
Darling...

774
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,292
...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

775
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:07,719
It's amazing.
You could almost <i>pass</i> for a gentleman.

776
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,134
Almost.

777
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,886
This is extraordinary.

778
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,153
This is a remarkable voyage.

779
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,820
- Mad.
- Completely lunatic.

780
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,570
There's the Countess of Rothes.

781
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,659
That's John Jacob Astor...

782
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,999
...the richest man on board.

783
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:45,169
His little wifey, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

784
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,001
See how she tries to hide ii.

785
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,673
Quite the scandal.

786
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:54,676
Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,
Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...

787
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:58,600
...is at home with the children, of course.
And over here...

788
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,518
...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

789
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:04,109
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

790
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,695
Very popular with the royals

791
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,530
Congratulations. She's splendid.

792
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,358
Why, thank you.

793
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,614
Escort a lady to dinner'?

794
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,362
Certainly.

795
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,698
Sweet pea, sweet pea.

796
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:20,955
Ain't nothing to it.

797
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:26,207
They love money. Pretend like you own
a gold mine and you're in the club.

798
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,048
Hey, Astor.

799
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,551
Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.

800
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,721
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meei Jack Dawson.

801
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,478
Well, Jack...

802
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,559
..,are you of the Boston Dawsons?

803
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,150
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

804
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,735
Oh, yes.

805
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:52,733
<i>He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.</i>

806
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,740
<i>They assumed he was one of them.</i>

807
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,243
<i>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.</i>

808
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:03,749
<i>New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.</i>

809
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,836
<i>Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.</i>

810
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:13,342
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage,
Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good.

811
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:18,012
The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.

812
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,938
Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.

813
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,525
He was of help to my fiancée last night.

814
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,610
It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.

815
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,439
He showed me some of his work today.

816
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:37,786
Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.
Not to impugn ynurwnrk, sir.

817
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:49,623
Are all these mine'?

818
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,967
Stan from the outside and work in.

819
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,211
He knows every rivet in her.

820
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,805
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.

821
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,390
Thank you, Rose.

822
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,144
How do you take your caviar, sir'?

823
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,640
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

824
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:11,149
Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?

825
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,565
Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.

826
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,816
After that, I'm on God's good humor

827
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:19,240
How do you have means to travel?

828
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:24,329
I work my way from place to place.
Tramp steamers and such.

829
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:28,333
I won my ticket on Titanic
at a lucky hand at poker.

830
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,080
A very lucky hand.

831
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,999
All life is a game of luck.

832
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,091
A real man makes his own luck.
Right, Dawson?

833
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,601
And you find
that sort of rootless existence appealing?

834
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,272
Yes, ma'am, I do.

835
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:51,018
I've got everything I need
right here with me.

836
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:54,112
I have air in my lungs
and blank sheets of paper.

837
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:59,948
I love waking up, not knowing
what will happen or who I'll meet.

838
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,282
Where I'll wind up.

839
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,949
One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...

840
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:09,453
...now I'm on the grandest ship
in the world, with you fine people.

841
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:10,704
I'll take more of that.

842
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,042
Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.

843
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,879
You never know what hand you'll get dealt.

844
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,886
You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.

845
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,140
Make each day count.

846
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:27,971
Well said, Jack.

847
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,313
Hear, hear.

848
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:31,900
To making it count.

849
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,233
To making it count.

850
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:36,730
Bravo.

851
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:47,408
But Mr. Brown didn't know
I'd hidden the money in the stove

852
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:52,747
He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating
and lights a fire.

853
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,422
Next is brandy in the smoking room.

854
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,681
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

855
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:09,017
Now they retreat to congratulate each
other on being masters of the universe.

856
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,264
Ladies, thank you for your company.

857
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,022
May I escort you to the cabin?

858
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,268
No, I'll stay here.

859
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,103
Here, Molly.

860
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,106
Joining us, Dawson'?

861
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,784
You don't want to stay with the women.

862
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,620
No, thanks. I have to head back.

863
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:30,621
That's best. It'll be all business and polilics.
Wouldn't interest you.

864
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,375
But Dawson, good of you to come.

865
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,302
Must you go?

866
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,888
Time for me to row with the other slaves.

867
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,810
Good night, Rose.

868
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,345
Want to go to a real party'?

869
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,944
Is okay I put my hand here?

870
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,545
I can't understand you.

871
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,330
I'm going to dance with her now.

872
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,331
Come on.

873
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,917
<i>Come on. Come with me.</i>

874
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,093
Jack- Jack, wait

875
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,422
I can't do this.

876
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,515
We'll have to get a bit closer.

877
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:52,930
Like this.

878
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,935
You're still my best girl, Cora.

879
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:04,358
- I don't know the steps-
- Me, either. Just go with it

880
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,193
Don't think.

881
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,965
Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

882
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,306
\Nhal? Wait!

883
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,186
Jack, no.

884
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,696
--Beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

885
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,780
That's what Rockefeller said--
Supreme Court didn't swallow it

886
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:59,724
What? You think
a first-class girl can't drink?

887
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:02,972
Get out of here.

888
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:04,899
Are you all right'?

889
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:07,894
I'm fine.

890
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,146
Two out of three.

891
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,407
So...

892
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,568
...you think you're tough?

893
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,405
Let's see you do this.

894
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,414
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

895
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,186
Jesus!

896
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:43,600
You okay'?

897
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,439
I haven't done that in years.

898
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,276
Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go

899
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,644
Coffee, sir'?

900
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,236
You didn't come to me last night.

901
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,985
I was tired.

902
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:44,161
Your exertions below deck
were no doubt exhausting.

903
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,830
I see you had
that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

904
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:54,088
You will never behave like that again.

905
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,674
I'm not one of your mill foremen
who you can command.

906
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,848
I'm your fiancée.

907
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,513
My fiancée. My fiancée!

908
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,849
Yes, you are! And my wife!

909
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:15,690
My wife in practice,
if not yet by law, so you will honor me!

910
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,775
You will honor me the way
a wife honors her husband.

911
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,278
Because I will not be made a fool of.

912
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,954
Is this in any way unclear'?

913
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,036
No.

914
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,709
Good. Excuse me.

915
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,046
Oh, Miss Rose.

916
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,303
We had a little accident.

917
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,718
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

918
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,132
Let me help you.

919
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,055
It's all right, miss.

920
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,979
It's all right, miss.

921
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,907
Tea, Trudy.

922
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:20,590
You're not to see that boy again.
You understand?

923
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,265
Rose, I forbid ii.

924
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,262
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

925
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,267
This is not a game.

926
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:34,442
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

927
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:39,113
Of course I know.
You remind me every day.

928
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:45,036
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name-

929
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:47,952
That name is the only card we have to play.

930
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,287
I don't understand you.

931
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:54,955
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

932
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:57,962
How can you put this on me'?

933
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,709
Why are you being so selfish?

934
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,052
I'm being selfish?

935
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:08,472
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

936
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,146
Is that what you want'?

937
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:17,651
To see our fine things sold at auction?

938
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,155
Our memories scattered'?

939
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,998
It's so unfair.

940
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,171
Of course it's unfair.

941
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:39,840
We're women.

942
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,508
Our choices are never easy.

943
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:10,205
<i>Protect them by Thy guiding hand</i>

944
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:15,376
<i>From every peril on the land</i>

945
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:21,375
<i>O, spirit whom the Father sent</i>

946
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:26,217
<i>To spread abroad the firmament</i>

947
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:30,891
<i>O, wind of heaven, by Thy might</i>

948
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:36,064
<i>Save all who dare the eagle's ﬂight</i>

949
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:40,235
<i>And keep them by Thy watchful care...</i>

950
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,568
Hello, Mr_ Andrews.

951
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,246
I need to talk to someone.

952
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,745
You're not supposed to be in here.

953
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:05,009
I was here last night, remember'?

954
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:06,924
No. Now please turn around.

955
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,013
He'll tell you. I just need to talk-

956
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,430
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeV\fitt Bukater...

957
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:16,603
...are still appreciative of your assistance.

958
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:20,433
They asked me
to give you this in gratitude-

959
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,276
I don't want your money.

960
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:26,447
--And remind you you are
in third class and your presence here...

961
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,441
...is no longer appropriate.

962
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,034
Let me speak to Rose.

963
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:34,281
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
returns to where he belongs...

964
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,286
..,and that he stays there?

965
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,117
Yes, sir.

966
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,539
Come along, you.

967
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,794
<i>Hear us when we cry to Thee</i>

968
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:49,630
<i>For those in peril on the sea</i>

969
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,472
Why are there two steering wheels?

970
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,217
We use this one near shore.

971
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:58,142
Excuse me, sir.
Another ice warning, from the Nuordam.

972
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,730
Thank you, Sparks.

973
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,319
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

974
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:10,317
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've ordered the last boilers lit.

975
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:17,331
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

976
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,158
Okay, now let it go.

977
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:24,205
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice. That's excellent.

978
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:34,216
Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.

979
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,262
I did the sum
in my head...

980
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:40,388
...and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

981
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:44,225
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

982
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,735
About half, actually.

983
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,063
Rose, you miss nothing,
do you'?

984
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:52,070
In fact, I put in these new
type davits...

985
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,027
mwhich can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

986
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,864
But it was thought,
by some...

987
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,456
...the deck would look
too cluttered.

988
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:02,251
So, I was overruled.

989
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:05,747
It's a waste of deck space
as it is on an unsinkable ship.

990
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,878
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

991
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,467
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

992
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,424
She's all the lifeboat
you need.

993
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,757
Just keep heading aft. The next
stop will be the engine room.

994
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:25,441
Jack, this is impossible.
I can't see you.

995
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,603
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

996
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,448
Jack.
I'm engaged.

997
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,283
I'm marrying Cal.

998
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,236
I love Cal.

999
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,123
Rose...

1000
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:46,121
...you're no picnic. All right'?
You're a spoiled little brat even.

1001
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:50,959
But under that, you're the
most amazingly, astounding--

1002
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:52,965
...wonderful girl...

1003
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:55,509
...woman, that I've ever known.

1004
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,630
Jack, I--

1005
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,349
No, let me try and get
this out. You're ama--

1006
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,806
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

1007
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:07,141
I've got ten bucks
in my pocket.

1008
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:09,940
I have nothing to offer
you and I know that.

1009
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,817
I understand.

1010
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,444
But I'm too involved now.

1011
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:16,817
You jump, I jump.
Remember'?

1012
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:19,654
I can't tum away without
knowing you'll be all right.

1013
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:22,448
That's all that I want.

1014
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,326
Well, I'm fine.

1015
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,996
I'll be fine, Really.

1016
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:31,169
Really?

1017
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:34,836
I don't think so.

1018
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:38,134
They've got you trapped, Rose.

1019
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,632
And you're gonna die if you
don't break free.

1020
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:40,804
Maybe not right away...

1021
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,472
...because you're strong...

1022
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,189
---but sooner or later that
fire that I love about you, Rose---

1023
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:50,017
-..that fire is gonna
burn out-

1024
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,653
It's not up to you
to save me, Jack.

1025
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,368
You're right.

1026
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,368
Only you can do that.

1027
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,872
I'm going back.

1028
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:12,707
Leave me alone.

1029
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:27,392
Tell Lucile about the disaster
you had with the stationers-

1030
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,354
Well, of course the invitations
had to be sent back, twice.

1031
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:31,729
Oh, my dear.

1032
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,690
And the dreadful
bridesmaids' gowns.

1033
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:36,030
Let me tell you what an
odyssey that has been.

1034
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,528
Rose decided she
wanted lavender.

1035
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,447
She knows I detest the color.

1036
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,198
So, she did it only to spite me.

1037
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,405
If only you'd come to
me sooner.

1038
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:47,541
Ruth saw some of my designs in
La Mode Illustrée.

1039
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:51,211
They were for the trousseau of the Duchess
of Marlborough's youngest daughter.

1040
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,295
They were quite charming.

1041
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,290
But, I think you'll agree,
my dear, that together...

1042
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,755
...we've created something
of a phoenix from the ashes.

1043
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:13,559
Hello, Jack.

1044
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,116
I changed my mind.

1045
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,289
They said you might be up here.

1046
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:32,628
Give me your hand.

1047
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:41,470
Now close your eyes.

1048
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,139
Go on.

1049
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:48,970
Now, step up.

1050
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,183
Now, hold onto the railing.

1051
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:56,185
Keep your eyes closed.
Don't peek.

1052
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:57,436
I'm not.

1053
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,814
Now, step up onto the rail.

1054
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,820
Hold on. Hold on.

1055
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:09,164
Keep your eyes closed.

1056
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:10,999
Do you trust me'?

1057
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:12,835
I trust you.

1058
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:23,670
All right...

1059
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,548
---099" your eyes.

1060
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:33,639
I'm flying.

1061
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,140
Jack.

1062
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:04,379
<i>Come, Josephine, in my
flying machine. Going up...</i>

1063
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:08,557
<i>...she goes. Up she goes.</i>

1064
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:59,267
That was the last time
Titanic ever saw daylight.

1065
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,820
We're up to dusk the
night of the sinking.

1066
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:04,897
6 hours to go.

1067
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:08,154
Incredible. There's Smith and
he's standing there and...

1068
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,823
<i>...he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand...</i>

1069
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:13,072
...excuse me--his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1070
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,454
26 years of experience
working against him.

1071
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,915
He figures anything big
enough to sink, the ship...

1072
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,663
...they're gonna see in time to turn.

1073
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:23,582
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1074
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,630
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1075
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:29,137
Everything he knows
is wrong.

1076
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:45,654
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1077
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,150
- V\Iill this light do?
- What?

1078
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:51,827
Don't artists need good light'?

1079
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,329
That is true, but I'm not
used to working in...

1080
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,706
...such horrible conditions.

1081
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:58,834
Monet!

1082
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,334
- Do you know his work'?
- Of course.

1083
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:04,672
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1084
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,959
I know. It's extraordinary.

1085
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,806
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1086
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,139
Should we be expecting him
any time soon?

1087
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:19,980
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1088
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,351
That's nice.

1089
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,403
What is it,
a sapphire?

1090
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:28,313
A diamond.

1091
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,403
A very rare diamond.

1092
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:36,822
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1093
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,541
Wearing this.

1094
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:41,038
All right.

1095
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:44,871
Wearing only this.

1096
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:24,082
The last thing I need is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1097
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,041
As a paying customer...

1098
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,921
'..l expect to get
what I want.

1099
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:54,571
Over on the bed
...uh, the couch.

1100
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:04,743
Come. Lie down.

1101
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:09,748
- Tell me when ii looks right.
- Keep that.

1102
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:11,799
Put your arm back
the way it was.

1103
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:17,635
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1104
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:20,133
Right.

1105
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,307
Now, head down.

1106
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,808
Eyes to me.
Keep them on me.

1107
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,983
And try to stay still.

1108
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:52,499
So serious.

1109
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:36,878
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big Artiste.

1110
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:44,225
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1111
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:47,225
He does landscapes.

1112
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:50,061
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1113
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,733
No laughing.

1114
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:25,760
My heart was pounding
the whole time.

1115
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:30,097
It was the most erotic
moment of my life...

1116
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:36,111
..,up until then, at least.

1117
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:38,401
So what happened next?

1118
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:41,946
You mean,
did we do it?

1119
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,788
<i>Sony to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.</i>

1120
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,783
<i>Jack was very professional.</i>

1121
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:58,963
Thank you.

1122
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:08,435
What are you doing?

1123
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,600
Will you put this
back in the safe for me?

1124
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,493
Gentlemen, would you excuse me.

1125
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:29,823
None of the stewards
have seen her.

1126
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:33,703
This is absurd.
It's a ship.

1127
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,875
There's only so many
places she could be.

1128
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,835
Lovejoy, find her.

1129
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,483
- Clear.
- Yes.

1130
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:01,688
I don't think I've ever
seen such a flat calm.

1131
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:03,189
Like a mill pond.

1132
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:05,904
Not a breath of wind.

1133
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:10,031
It will make the bergs
harder to see...

1134
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,331
...with no breaking
water at the base.

1135
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:24,927
Well, I'm off.

1136
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,094
Maintain speed and
heading, Mr. Lightoller.

1137
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,092
Yes, sir.

1138
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:43,738
It's getting cold.
You look nice.

1139
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:45,407
Miss Rose'?

1140
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:47,572
My drawings!

1141
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:14,890
Come on!

1142
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:19,274
Wait, wait, wait!

1143
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:20,942
Wait, wait, wait!

1144
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,440
- Go. Go. Down, down.
- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!

1145
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:32,070
Bye.

1146
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:41,296
Sorry.

1147
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:48,299
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1148
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,519
Pretty tough for
a valet, this fella.

1149
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,267
Seems more like a cop.

1150
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:03,601
I think he was.

1151
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:05,937
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1152
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:12,319
No, over here!

1153
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:13,824
Quick!

1154
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:21,999
Now what?

1155
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:23,630
What?

1156
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:30,508
More coal for number
one, mate.

1157
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:33,298
Hold up? What are you two
doing down here?

1158
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,841
You shouldn't be down here.

1159
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:36,222
It could be dangerous!

1160
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:41,639
Carry on!

1161
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:44,063
Don't mind us. You're
doing a great job!

1162
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,561
Keep up the good work!

1163
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:03,870
Look at what we have here, huh'?

1164
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:23,398
Thank you.

1165
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:36,911
Where to, miss'?

1166
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:39,744
To the stars.

1167
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:00,260
You nervous'?

1168
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,892
No.

1169
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,782
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1170
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:48,308
<i>It's bloody cold.</i>

1171
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:52,312
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1172
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:54,989
Bollocks!

1173
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:56,988
Well, I can, all right'?

1174
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,445
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

1175
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,495
Haven't seen them
since Southampton.

1176
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:03,498
Well, I'll be on
my rounds.

1177
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:05,450
Cheerio.

1178
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,032
You're trembling.

1179
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:41,657
Don't worry.

1180
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:43,405
I'll be all right.

1181
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,560
- They ran down there.
- Right.

1182
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:17,985
A"Ylhing missing?

1183
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:44,849
I have a better idea.

1184
01:36:57,687 --> 01:36:58,859
(3011 you!

1185
01:37:08,114 --> 01:37:10,958
Did you see those guys' faces?

1186
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:13,377
Did you see them?

1187
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:21,552
When the ship docks...

1188
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:24,631
...I'm getting off with you.

1189
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:27,217
This is crazy.

1190
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:30,060
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

1191
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:33,056
That's why I trust it.

1192
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:44,739
Here, look at this.

1193
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:47,570
Look at that, would you'?

1194
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:49,406
They're warmer than we are.

1195
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:54,168
If that's what it takes for us to get warm,
I'd rather not.

1196
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:07,924
Bugger me!

1197
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:14,764
Pick up, you bastards!

1198
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:19,435
<i>Is anyone there?!</i>

1199
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:20,857
What do you see?

1200
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,526
Iceberg, right ahead!

1201
01:38:22,772 --> 01:38:23,864
Thank you.

1202
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:27,364
Iceberg ahead!

1203
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,362
Hard a' starboard!

1204
01:38:36,285 --> 01:38:38,538
Turn! Turn! Smartly!

1205
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:44,794
Full astern!

1206
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,302
Hard over.

1207
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:49,970
Helm's hard over, sir.

1208
01:38:53,636 --> 01:38:55,138
Go, lads, go!

1209
01:38:57,557 --> 01:39:00,310
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!

1210
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:04,989
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1211
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:10,820
Hold it.

1212
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:13,656
Hold it!

1213
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:16,826
Now! Engage reversing engine!

1214
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:47,357
Why ain't they turning'?

1215
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:48,779
Is it hard over'?!

1216
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:51,027
It is, sir. Hard over.

1217
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:59,207
Come on, come on, come on- Turn

1218
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:11,722
Yes.

1219
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:18,559
It's going to hit!

1220
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:31,484
Jesus Christ!

1221
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,427
Jesus!

1222
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:54,674
Hard to port!

1223
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:56,267
Hard to port!

1224
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:07,604
Get back!

1225
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:38,392
Let's go!

1226
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:41,979
They're closing the doors! Get out!

1227
01:41:48,477 --> 01:41:50,821
Get out the door! Go!

1228
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:54,151
Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1229
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:05,499
Go! Go!

1230
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:07,997
Out! Out!

1231
01:42:22,678 --> 01:42:24,351
Oh, my God.

1232
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:26,524
That was a close shave.

1233
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:29,773
Smell ice, can you'? Bleedin' Christ!

1234
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:36,700
Note the time. Enter it in the log.

1235
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:44,121
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1236
01:42:45,034 --> 01:42:46,456
An iceberg, sir.

1237
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:51,040
I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.

1238
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:53,547
I tried to port round it, but--

1239
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:57,050
- Close the watertight doors.
- They're closed, sir.

1240
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:01,388
All stop.

1241
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:12,899
Have the carpenter sound the ship.

1242
01:43:24,573 --> 01:43:27,918
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

1243
01:43:32,748 --> 01:43:35,592
Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.

1244
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:38,509
Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.

1245
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:41,598
That's the shudder you fell.
Do you need anything?

1246
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:43,517
No, thank you.

1247
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:50,934
There's talk of an iceberg.

1248
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:52,935
I don't see anything. Do you'?

1249
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:58,278
If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.

1250
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:06,954
- You.
- There is no emergency.

1251
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:10,043
- There is. I've been robbed.
- Get the Master at Arms.

1252
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:12,292
Now, you moron!

1253
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:18,302
Did I miss the fun'?

1254
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:23,137
- Did you see what happened?
- No- I guess it hit over there-

1255
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:28,555
Boiler room six is ﬂooded eight feet
and the mail hold is worse.

1256
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:31,227
- Can you shore up'?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1257
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:34,648
- Have you seen the mail hold?
- It's already underwater.

1258
01:44:35,227 --> 01:44:36,900
This is bad.

1259
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:40,824
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1260
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:43,995
I think they're very good, sir.

1261
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:49,826
Don't touch anything.
I want the room photographed.

1262
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,003
We've been looking for you, miss.

1263
01:45:01,837 --> 01:45:02,929
Here we go.

1264
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:10,266
Something serious has happened.

1265
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:13,349
Yes, it has.

1266
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:18,275
Indeed.
Two things dear to me have disappeared.

1267
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:22,697
Now that one is back,
I know where to find the other. Search him.

1268
01:45:22,942 --> 01:45:24,785
- Take your coat off.
- Now what?

1269
01:45:25,945 --> 01:45:29,950
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of an emergency.

1270
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:32,293
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1271
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:34,711
This is horses-hit!

1272
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:37,381
Don't you believe it.

1273
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:41,051
- He couldn't have.
- Easy enough for a professional.

1274
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,796
I was with him the entire time.

1275
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:47,050
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1276
01:45:48,717 --> 01:45:50,970
Real slick. They put it in my pocket.

1277
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:54,064
- Shut up.
-ll isn't even your pocket.

1278
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:55,808
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1279
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:01,647
That was reported stolen.

1280
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:03,490
I just borrowed it.

1281
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:06,076
Oh, we have an honest thief.

1282
01:46:06,402 --> 01:46:08,575
You know I didn't do this, Rose.

1283
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:11,407
Don't believe them. You know it.

1284
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:12,658
Let's go, son.

1285
01:46:12,908 --> 01:46:14,751
You know I didn't do it!

1286
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:18,081
There's a good lad. Come on.

1287
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:20,758
You know I didn't do it! You know me!

1288
01:46:22,668 --> 01:46:24,921
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1289
01:46:28,424 --> 01:46:31,849
Water fourteen feet above the keel
in ten minutes...

1290
01:46:32,094 --> 01:46:35,439
...in the forepeak,
all three holds and boiler room six.

1291
01:46:35,681 --> 01:46:36,682
That's right.

1292
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:38,275
When can we get underway?

1293
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:40,519
Th at's five compartments.

1294
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:46,443
She can float with four compartments breached,
but not five.

1295
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:50,784
Not five. As she goes down,
the water will spill...

1296
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:55,206
...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,
one to the next...

1297
01:46:55,451 --> 01:46:58,125
..,back and back. There's no stopping it.

1298
01:46:58,454 --> 01:46:59,706
The IJUmP$-

1299
01:46:59,955 --> 01:47:03,129
The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.

1300
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:06,045
As of now, no matter what we do...

1301
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:09,135
...Titanic will founder.

1302
01:47:11,467 --> 01:47:12,810
But this ship can't sink.

1303
01:47:13,052 --> 01:47:15,896
She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.

1304
01:47:16,472 --> 01:47:17,473
And she will.

1305
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:20,401
It's a mathematical certainty

1306
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:26,315
How much time?

1307
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:36,325
An hour. Two, at most.

1308
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:44,425
How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch'?

1309
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:47,677
Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.

1310
01:47:54,343 --> 01:47:57,847
Well, I believe you may get your headlines,
Mr. lsmay.

1311
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:17,537
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it'?

1312
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:20,540
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1313
01:48:20,786 --> 01:48:22,959
- Mr. Hockley'?
- Not now. We're busy.

1314
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:26,630
You've been asked to put on Iifebelts
and go to the boat deck.

1315
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:27,876
I said, not now.

1316
01:48:28,127 --> 01:48:33,133
I'm sorry, Mr_ Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.
Dress warmly.

1317
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:35,555
It's quite cold out.

1318
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:38,728
May I suggest topcoats and hats'?

1319
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:40,897
This is ridiculous.

1320
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:45,232
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1321
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:47,563
Everybody up! Lifebelts on!

1322
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:50,824
What's he on about?

1323
01:48:51,734 --> 01:48:53,577
- Put your Iifebelts on!
- What is it?

1324
01:48:53,819 --> 01:48:55,162
Just put them on.

1325
01:48:56,405 --> 01:48:57,577
C.Q.D.?

1326
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,412
Sir'?

1327
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:04,922
That's right, O.Q.D. The distress call.
That's our position.

1328
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:14,757
Tell whoever responds we're going down
and need immediate assistance.

1329
01:49:24,266 --> 01:49:25,609
Blimey.

1330
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:37,621
Keep lowering!

1331
01:49:37,946 --> 01:49:39,948
Keep lowering!

1332
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:47,632
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1333
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:55,465
Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!

1334
01:49:55,798 --> 01:49:57,471
Release those ties!

1335
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:00,553
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1336
01:50:01,136 --> 01:50:02,638
Where are the passengers?

1337
01:50:02,888 --> 01:50:06,233
They went inside. Too cold and noisy for them.

1338
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:10,821
You there! Get down here
and help with these lines!

1339
01:50:24,993 --> 01:50:26,836
Care for a drink, sir'?

1340
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:34,258
Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up
and now we're cooling our heels.

1341
01:50:34,503 --> 01:50:37,006
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1342
01:50:37,673 --> 01:50:40,017
Nobody knows what's going on.

1343
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:43,183
Just like the damn English--everything by the book.

1344
01:50:43,428 --> 01:50:46,352
No need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1345
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:51,195
Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.
I want a cup of tea when I return.

1346
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:03,031
Mr. Andrews.

1347
01:51:05,033 --> 01:51:08,378
I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.

1348
01:51:08,704 --> 01:51:10,377
Please tell me the truth.

1349
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,390
The ship will sink.

1350
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:23,135
You're certain?

1351
01:51:24,219 --> 01:51:29,066
In an hour or so, all this
will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1352
01:51:31,727 --> 01:51:36,073
Please, tell only who you must.
I don't want to cause a panic.

1353
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:39,242
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.

1354
01:51:39,902 --> 01:51:43,076
You remember what I told you about the boats'?

1355
01:51:45,407 --> 01:51:46,750
Yes.

1356
01:51:48,577 --> 01:51:50,079
I understand.

1357
01:51:58,086 --> 01:51:59,429
Over here, son.

1358
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:03,596
Sir, there's a big mob
at the Second Class Purser's ofﬂce.

1359
01:52:03,926 --> 01:52:05,678
Go on. I'll watch him.

1360
01:52:06,428 --> 01:52:08,430
Aye. Right.

1361
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:27,116
Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.
Full steam for them, sir.

1362
01:52:28,951 --> 01:52:30,373
She's the only one responding?

1363
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:34,214
The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.

1364
01:52:34,957 --> 01:52:36,630
Four hours'?!

1365
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:43,132
Thank you, Bride.

1366
01:52:47,469 --> 01:52:49,142
My God.

1367
01:52:58,647 --> 01:53:00,649
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1368
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:06,075
Hadn't we better get the women and children
into the boats?

1369
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:08,991
Yes.

1370
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:16,335
Women and children first, yes.

1371
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:19,176
Yes, sir.

1372
01:53:22,004 --> 01:53:24,678
Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!

1373
01:53:25,173 --> 01:53:27,676
Step this way, please. That's right.

1374
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:30,854
Come towards me. Thank you.

1375
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:32,848
Good.

1376
01:53:33,098 --> 01:53:37,353
Forthe time being,
I require only women and children.

1377
01:53:37,853 --> 01:53:39,025
Right here.

1378
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:43,693
Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1379
01:53:44,693 --> 01:53:46,036
"Wedding Dance."

1380
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:57,039
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1381
01:53:57,372 --> 01:54:00,046
Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.

1382
01:54:00,375 --> 01:54:03,379
Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.

1383
01:54:08,717 --> 01:54:11,061
It isn't time to go to the boats yet!

1384
01:54:11,386 --> 01:54:13,059
Please, stay calm.

1385
01:54:13,388 --> 01:54:16,562
Make sure you have your lifebelts on.

1386
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:19,315
Let women and children through to the front.

1387
01:54:19,561 --> 01:54:20,904
What are we doing?

1388
01:54:21,146 --> 01:54:24,241
Waiting. Once first-class people
are in the boats...

1389
01:54:24,483 --> 01:54:27,828
...they'll start with us and we want to be ready.

1390
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:31,240
Pushing won't get you out any faster.

1391
01:54:31,573 --> 01:54:32,916
Go get help.

1392
01:54:33,241 --> 01:54:37,246
Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.

1393
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:40,917
Both sides together! Steady!

1394
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:42,421
Steady!

1395
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:44,094
Steady!

1396
01:54:45,587 --> 01:54:47,589
Stop, stop. stop!

1397
01:54:48,423 --> 01:54:49,595
Hold the left!

1398
01:54:49,925 --> 01:54:52,428
Right side only! Right side only!

1399
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:53,933
Right side!

1400
01:54:54,262 --> 01:54:58,108
Hold the left! Right side down!
Lower away together!

1401
01:55:00,268 --> 01:55:01,941
Steady, lads!

1402
01:55:49,317 --> 01:55:52,821
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1403
01:55:54,823 --> 01:55:59,499
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1404
01:56:01,997 --> 01:56:04,671
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1405
01:56:11,423 --> 01:56:14,097
Come on, sister, you heard
the man. Into the boat.

1406
01:56:14,426 --> 01:56:16,554
Any room for a gentleman,
gentlemen?

1407
01:56:16,761 --> 01:56:18,104
Only women at this time, sir.

1408
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:23,811
VWI the lifeboats be
seated according to class?

1409
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:28,448
I hope they're not too crowded.

1410
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:31,075
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1411
01:56:31,943 --> 01:56:33,115
Don't you understand?

1412
01:56:33,612 --> 01:56:35,330
The water IS freezing and
there aren't enough boats

1413
01:56:35,614 --> 01:56:37,241
Not enough by half.

1414
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:40,619
Half the people on this
ship are going to die.

1415
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:42,579
Not the better half.

1416
01:56:44,456 --> 01:56:45,503
Come on, Ruth,
gel in the boat.

1417
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:47,959
First class seats
are right up here.

1418
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:51,095
You know, it's a pity I didn't
keep that drawing.

1419
01:56:51,087 --> 01:56:52,680
It'll be worth a lot
more by morning.

1420
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:59,309
You unimaginable bastard.

1421
01:57:00,096 --> 01:57:02,098
Come on, Rose darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1422
01:57:03,975 --> 01:57:05,022
Come on, Rose.

1423
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:07,146
You're next, darling.

1424
01:57:07,479 --> 01:57:08,651
Come into the boat, Rose.

1425
01:57:11,107 --> 01:57:12,108
Come.

1426
01:57:12,442 --> 01:57:13,489
Rose.

1427
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:15,616
Get into the boat!

1428
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:18,114
Rose.

1429
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:20,454
Good-bye, Mother.

1430
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:26,123
Where are you going?

1431
01:57:26,831 --> 01:57:27,832
To him'?!

1432
01:57:28,792 --> 01:57:30,294
To be a whore
to a gutter rat?

1433
01:57:31,503 --> 01:57:33,847
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

1434
01:57:36,216 --> 01:57:38,344
No!

1435
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:41,054
I said, no!

1436
01:57:42,347 --> 01:57:44,691
Rose!
Please, stop!

1437
01:57:45,976 --> 01:57:47,319
And, lower away!

1438
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:49,737
No, Wait!

1439
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:50,821
Lower away!

1440
01:57:50,814 --> 01:57:52,691
- Rose!
- Lower together!

1441
01:57:53,358 --> 01:57:54,735
Hold the left side!

1442
01:57:58,655 --> 01:57:59,656
Help!

1443
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:02,660
Can anybody hear me?!

1444
01:58:04,035 --> 01:58:05,708
Hello! Help me!

1445
01:58:06,538 --> 01:58:07,539
HelP me!

1446
01:58:08,373 --> 01:58:10,375
Can you hear me?!

1447
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:14,714
Can anybody hear me'?!
Somebody help me!

1448
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,382
Mr. And rews'?!

1449
01:58:21,052 --> 01:58:23,225
Steward, check the
starboard corridor.

1450
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:26,016
Madame, please put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1451
01:58:26,558 --> 01:58:29,277
Lucy, for God's sake put on your
lifebelt and set a good example.

1452
01:58:29,269 --> 01:58:30,270
Yes sir.

1453
01:58:30,895 --> 01:58:32,238
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews!

1454
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:34,407
Mr. Andrews!
Thank God!

1455
01:58:34,691 --> 01:58:37,035
Where would the Master at Arms
take someone under arrest?

1456
01:58:37,611 --> 01:58:39,033
What? You have to get
to a boat right away.

1457
01:58:39,029 --> 01:58:40,076
No!

1458
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:42,369
I'm doing this with or
without your help, sir.

1459
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:43,908
But without will take longer.

1460
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:49,214
Take the elevator to the
very bottom. Go to the left...

1461
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:50,422
...down the crewmen's passage.

1462
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:53,294
Then go right and left
again at the stairs-

1463
01:58:53,293 --> 01:58:54,545
You'll come
to a long corridor.

1464
01:58:59,424 --> 01:59:01,097
This could be bad.

1465
01:59:04,929 --> 01:59:07,603
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

1466
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:14,939
Excuse me. Thank you.

1467
01:59:18,443 --> 01:59:21,447
I'm sorry, miss,
but the lifls are closed.

1468
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:25,250
I'm through being polite,
goddamnit!

1469
01:59:25,241 --> 01:59:26,333
Now take me down!

1470
01:59:27,619 --> 01:59:28,962
E deck.

1471
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:33,633
Come on.

1472
01:59:34,084 --> 01:59:35,427
Come on, come on.

1473
01:59:53,269 --> 01:59:54,646
I'm going back up.

1474
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:56,819
No! No! No!

1475
02:00:00,985 --> 02:00:02,828
Come back!
I'm going back up!

1476
02:00:03,154 --> 02:00:04,155
I'm going back up!

1477
02:00:13,164 --> 02:00:14,165
Crew passage.

1478
02:00:37,522 --> 02:00:38,523
Jack!

1479
02:00:51,327 --> 02:00:52,328
Rose!

1480
02:00:54,748 --> 02:00:56,170
Rose, I'm in here!

1481
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:58,093
I'm in here!

1482
02:00:58,626 --> 02:00:59,718
I'm in here!

1483
02:01:01,921 --> 02:01:03,923
Jack! I'm sorry.

1484
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:06,601
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1485
02:01:07,594 --> 02:01:09,016
That guy Lovejoy put
it in my pocket.

1486
02:01:09,012 --> 02:01:11,014
I know, I know, I know.

1487
02:01:11,014 --> 02:01:12,186
Listen Rose...

1488
02:01:12,182 --> 02:01:14,685
...you're gonna have to find
the spare key, all right?

1489
02:01:14,684 --> 02:01:16,027
Look in that
cabinet right there.

1490
02:01:17,562 --> 02:01:19,485
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1491
02:01:22,066 --> 02:01:23,568
These are all
brass ones!

1492
02:01:24,444 --> 02:01:25,946
Check right here, Rose.

1493
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:31,534
Rose.

1494
02:01:32,869 --> 02:01:34,462
How did you find out I didn't do it'?

1495
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:36,039
I didn't.

1496
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:38,041
I just realized
I already knew.

1497
02:01:40,627 --> 02:01:41,628
Keep looking.

1498
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:52,017
No key.

1499
02:01:52,555 --> 02:01:53,647
There's no key!

1500
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,641
All right, Rose, listen.

1501
02:01:54,974 --> 02:01:56,351
You're gonna have
to go find some help.

1502
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:58,228
It'll be all right.

1503
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:05,072
I'll be right back.

1504
02:02:12,659 --> 02:02:14,502
I'll just wait here!

1505
02:02:27,799 --> 02:02:29,016
Hello?
ls there anyone here?

1506
02:02:30,218 --> 02:02:31,219
Hello?

1507
02:02:31,845 --> 02:02:33,472
Is there anybody
down here?

1508
02:02:34,681 --> 02:02:36,479
We need help! Hello?

1509
02:02:38,184 --> 02:02:39,185
Damnit!

1510
02:02:45,692 --> 02:02:49,538
Can anybody hear me, please?!
Hello?! Hello?!

1511
02:02:51,531 --> 02:02:52,874
Oh, thank God.

1512
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:54,325
Wait, please, I need your help.

1513
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:55,618
There's a man back
here and he's--

1514
02:02:56,494 --> 02:02:57,495
Wait!

1515
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:03,051
Hello'?!

1516
02:03:28,818 --> 02:03:29,865
Hello?

1517
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:32,823
Miss, you shouldn't
be here now.

1518
02:03:33,114 --> 02:03:34,331
I need your help.

1519
02:03:34,699 --> 02:03:36,451
There is a man down
here and he is trapped.

1520
02:03:36,659 --> 02:03:37,660
- This way, yes. All right.
- Please!

1521
02:03:37,994 --> 02:03:39,837
- There's no need to panic.
- No, I'm not panicking!

1522
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:41,922
You're going the
wrong way!

1523
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:44,000
Let go of me!
Listen!!!

1524
02:03:49,672 --> 02:03:50,673
To hell with you.

1525
02:04:28,628 --> 02:04:30,130
Oh, my God.

1526
02:05:22,181 --> 02:05:23,774
V\fill this work'?

1527
02:05:24,684 --> 02:05:25,776
I guess we'll
find out.

1528
02:05:26,436 --> 02:05:27,437
Come on.

1529
02:05:30,523 --> 02:05:31,524
Wait, wait, wail.

1530
02:05:32,191 --> 02:05:33,693
Try a couple practice
swings over there.

1531
02:05:39,907 --> 02:05:40,908
Good.

1532
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:42,998
Now try and hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

1533
02:05:49,709 --> 02:05:52,337
Okay, that's enough practice.
Come on, Rose.

1534
02:05:52,336 --> 02:05:53,929
You can do it.

1535
02:05:54,213 --> 02:05:57,888
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1536
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:00,637
Come on_ Wail.

1537
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:02,889
Open your
hands up a little more.

1538
02:06:03,222 --> 02:06:04,565
- Like that?
- Right.

1539
02:06:05,558 --> 02:06:07,606
Listen, Rose,
I trust you.

1540
02:06:12,565 --> 02:06:13,566
Go.

1541
02:06:19,906 --> 02:06:20,953
You did it!

1542
02:06:21,574 --> 02:06:22,917
Come on. Let's go.

1543
02:06:23,576 --> 02:06:25,578
Oh shit, this is cold!
Oh, shit!

1544
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:27,505
Shit! Shit!

1545
02:06:33,086 --> 02:06:34,178
This is the way out.

1546
02:06:35,254 --> 02:06:37,757
We have to find
another way. Come on.

1547
02:06:40,802 --> 02:06:41,803
Pull.

1548
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:43,846
Put your backs into it.

1549
02:06:49,811 --> 02:06:50,812
Pull!

1550
02:06:51,771 --> 02:06:54,615
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1551
02:07:16,462 --> 02:07:19,432
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. Get rid of it.

1552
02:07:19,423 --> 02:07:20,515
We need the room.
Get rid of that. Out.

1553
02:07:22,385 --> 02:07:25,389
This way.
Let go, sir. Gel back.

1554
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:26,981
Keep calm!

1555
02:07:34,313 --> 02:07:35,314
LoveJ'0Y!

1556
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:37,692
She's not on the starboard side either.

1557
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:41,989
We're running out of time. This strutting
martinet isn't letting any men on at all.

1558
02:07:42,655 --> 02:07:44,657
There's one on the other
side letting men on.

1559
02:07:45,324 --> 02:07:46,792
Well then, that's our play.

1560
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:49,458
We'll need some
insurance first. Come on.

1561
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:52,423
This way, please.
All the way down here.

1562
02:07:55,501 --> 02:07:56,502
Here!

1563
02:07:57,712 --> 02:07:59,009
What do you
think you're doing?

1564
02:07:59,505 --> 02:08:01,507
You'll have to pay for
that, you know.

1565
02:08:01,757 --> 02:08:03,509
That's White Star
Line properly.

1566
02:08:03,843 --> 02:08:05,345
Shut up!

1567
02:08:06,179 --> 02:08:09,353
VWII you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room--

1568
02:08:10,183 --> 02:08:11,230
Sit down!

1569
02:08:11,851 --> 02:08:13,068
She's the last.

1570
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:14,983
- Prepare to lower.
- Mr. Lighloller.

1571
02:08:14,979 --> 02:08:16,902
Why are the boats being
launched half full?

1572
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:18,191
Not now, Mr. Andrews.

1573
02:08:18,441 --> 02:08:21,615
There, look. 20 or so
in a boat built for 65'?

1574
02:08:21,861 --> 02:08:23,863
And I saw one boat
with only 12- 12!

1575
02:08:24,197 --> 02:08:27,246
Well, we weren't sure of
the weight, Mr. Andrews.

1576
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:28,576
These boats may
buckle.

1577
02:08:28,784 --> 02:08:29,785
Rubbish!

1578
02:08:30,036 --> 02:08:32,710
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1579
02:08:33,122 --> 02:08:35,591
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake man!

1580
02:08:42,882 --> 02:08:45,726
Please, I need more women
and children, please!

1581
02:08:51,057 --> 02:08:52,229
Get back in there!

1582
02:08:52,558 --> 02:08:55,061
This is not an exit.
This is not an exit.

1583
02:08:57,647 --> 02:09:00,321
You can't keep us locked in here.
Like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1584
02:09:01,567 --> 02:09:03,569
Bring forward the women!

1585
02:09:03,903 --> 02:09:05,405
Unlock the gates.

1586
02:09:06,239 --> 02:09:08,241
Women only!

1587
02:09:08,908 --> 02:09:10,581
No men!

1588
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:12,412
No men!

1589
02:09:16,916 --> 02:09:18,793
Get back!

1590
02:09:20,086 --> 02:09:21,258
Get back!

1591
02:09:21,254 --> 02:09:22,631
Lock the gates!

1592
02:09:23,422 --> 02:09:24,799
Get them back
from those gates!

1593
02:09:26,175 --> 02:09:27,472
Don't touch the gates!

1594
02:09:31,097 --> 02:09:32,599
For God's sake, man...

1595
02:09:32,598 --> 02:09:34,145
mthere are women and
children down here!

1596
02:09:34,433 --> 02:09:36,777
Let us up so we can have a chance!

1597
02:09:37,812 --> 02:09:38,813
Get back!

1598
02:09:42,566 --> 02:09:43,783
Tommy!

1599
02:09:43,776 --> 02:09:45,278
- Can we get out'?
- It's hopeless that way.

1600
02:09:45,611 --> 02:09:47,033
Whatever we do,
we've got to do it fast.

1601
02:09:50,783 --> 02:09:52,205
The boats are all going.

1602
02:09:52,535 --> 02:09:54,458
This whole place is ﬂooding.
We've goﬂa gel out of here.

1603
02:09:54,453 --> 02:09:55,500
There is niente this way.

1604
02:09:56,622 --> 02:09:57,874
Let's go this way, all right?
Come on!

1605
02:10:03,963 --> 02:10:05,135
I make my own luck.

1606
02:10:05,464 --> 02:10:06,966
So do I.

1607
02:10:14,807 --> 02:10:16,150
Come on!

1608
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:17,689
No, come on, let's go this way.

1609
02:10:27,236 --> 02:10:28,408
This way!

1610
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,657
Just go back to
the main stairwell.

1611
02:10:31,824 --> 02:10:33,121
And everything will be
sorted out there.

1612
02:10:34,577 --> 02:10:36,420
It will all get sorted out back there.

1613
02:10:36,787 --> 02:10:38,039
Go back to the main stairwell.

1614
02:10:38,039 --> 02:10:40,007
- Open the gate!
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1615
02:10:40,249 --> 02:10:41,592
Open the gate right now!

1616
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:43,928
Go back down the main
stairwell, like I told you-

1617
02:10:46,172 --> 02:10:48,675
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

1618
02:10:49,008 --> 02:10:50,681
Stop that!

1619
02:10:54,597 --> 02:10:55,723
Fabri, Tommy,
give me a hand here.

1620
02:10:55,723 --> 02:10:56,815
Move aside.

1621
02:10:56,807 --> 02:10:58,980
Come on, pull!

1622
02:10:59,852 --> 02:11:00,853
Pull!

1623
02:11:01,854 --> 02:11:03,276
Move aside.
Quickly, move aside!

1624
02:11:03,272 --> 02:11:04,364
Put that down!

1625
02:11:04,357 --> 02:11:05,700
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1626
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:07,034
One! Two!

1627
02:11:07,943 --> 02:11:09,115
Three!

1628
02:11:11,364 --> 02:11:12,536
Again!

1629
02:11:14,533 --> 02:11:15,580
Now, let's go!

1630
02:11:17,912 --> 02:11:19,038
Let's go, Rose.

1631
02:11:19,038 --> 02:11:21,211
You can't go up there!
You can't do this!

1632
02:11:27,546 --> 02:11:29,389
Keep order! Keep order here!

1633
02:11:29,715 --> 02:11:32,559
Back! Back! Back!

1634
02:11:37,139 --> 02:11:38,140
Hold on to her!

1635
02:11:39,725 --> 02:11:40,772
Pull her in!

1636
02:11:41,727 --> 02:11:44,230
Get back, I say, or I'll...

1637
02:11:44,563 --> 02:11:46,736
...shoot you all like dogs!

1638
02:11:47,066 --> 02:11:48,568
Keep order here!

1639
02:11:49,568 --> 02:11:51,741
Keep order, I say.

1640
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:54,744
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1641
02:11:59,245 --> 02:12:03,421
Right. ls everybody all right'?
Nobody panic.

1642
02:12:09,588 --> 02:12:11,261
Stay back.

1643
02:12:11,757 --> 02:12:12,929
We're too late.

1644
02:12:13,175 --> 02:12:16,270
There are more boats down the front
Stay with this one- Murdoch-

1645
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:18,059
He seems to be quite practical.

1646
02:12:22,768 --> 02:12:24,270
Don't lower it!

1647
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:26,772
Cut the falls!

1648
02:12:32,278 --> 02:12:34,121
Sit down!

1649
02:12:35,448 --> 02:12:36,870
Stay back, you lot!

1650
02:12:37,116 --> 02:12:40,290
Just stay back, the
lot of you! Stay back!

1651
02:12:42,955 --> 02:12:45,629
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1652
02:12:47,293 --> 02:12:48,636
Mr. Murdoch?

1653
02:12:48,961 --> 02:12:51,464
Mr. Hockley.
You two, with me, now!

1654
02:12:51,714 --> 02:12:53,466
I'm a businessman, as you know...

1655
02:12:53,466 --> 02:12:55,059
...and I have a business
proposition for you.

1656
02:13:02,808 --> 02:13:03,980
Come on, Rose.

1657
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:08,481
The boats are gone!

1658
02:13:14,153 --> 02:13:15,826
Colonel, are there
any boats on that side?

1659
02:13:16,071 --> 02:13:18,620
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1660
02:13:18,616 --> 02:13:20,209
This way, I'll lead you.

1661
02:13:26,415 --> 02:13:29,760
What's the use'?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1662
02:13:30,002 --> 02:13:31,675
Well, they don't listen to
us at dinner, either.

1663
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:32,887
Come on, let's play.

1664
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,223
Keep us warm.

1665
02:13:35,007 --> 02:13:36,350
"Orpheus."

1666
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:43,979
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1667
02:13:49,855 --> 02:13:53,200
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1668
02:13:55,194 --> 02:13:57,367
We have an understanding
then, Mr. Murdoch.

1669
02:14:08,707 --> 02:14:12,712
V\fill the men please hold
back! Hold back, I say!

1670
02:14:15,047 --> 02:14:18,017
Women and children only!

1671
02:14:18,008 --> 02:14:19,931
Get back!

1672
02:14:20,219 --> 02:14:22,893
Come through, madame.
This way. Step back, sir!

1673
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:27,234
You better check the
other side. Go!

1674
02:14:34,567 --> 02:14:36,410
I found her, on the other side.

1675
02:14:37,069 --> 02:14:38,491
Waiting for a boat.

1676
02:14:38,988 --> 02:14:39,989
Wan him

1677
02:14:41,657 --> 02:14:43,751
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1678
02:14:44,076 --> 02:14:45,919
Anyone else then'?

1679
02:14:47,496 --> 02:14:48,918
- Anyone else?
- Do hurry. Hurry along.

1680
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:57,089
Goddamn it all to hell.

1681
02:14:59,758 --> 02:15:01,101
Shit.

1682
02:15:01,385 --> 02:15:02,386
Fire!

1683
02:15:03,804 --> 02:15:05,727
Sir, sir, you can't
go through here.

1684
02:15:09,351 --> 02:15:11,695
That's it.
Splendid. Right.

1685
02:15:15,608 --> 02:15:17,281
Prepare to lower.

1686
02:15:19,445 --> 02:15:21,288
Ready on the left.

1687
02:15:27,202 --> 02:15:28,875
Take them down.

1688
02:15:33,709 --> 02:15:35,052
Keep it steady.

1689
02:15:37,713 --> 02:15:41,638
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1690
02:15:42,676 --> 02:15:44,019
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1691
02:15:44,845 --> 02:15:47,189
It'll be fine, darling.
Don't you worry.

1692
02:15:47,514 --> 02:15:49,187
Daddy, get in the boat.

1693
02:15:49,516 --> 02:15:52,360
It's good-bye for a little
while- Only for a little while

1694
02:15:52,603 --> 02:15:54,651
There'll be another
boat for the daddies.

1695
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:56,527
This boat is for the
mummies and the children.

1696
02:15:56,523 --> 02:15:58,617
You hold Mummy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1697
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:01,453
I'm not going without you.

1698
02:16:01,695 --> 02:16:03,368
No, you have
to go, now.

1699
02:16:03,364 --> 02:16:04,490
No, Jack.

1700
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:05,867
Get in the
boat, Rose.

1701
02:16:05,866 --> 02:16:07,118
No, Jack.

1702
02:16:07,117 --> 02:16:08,209
Yes.

1703
02:16:08,202 --> 02:16:09,294
Get on the boat!

1704
02:16:09,286 --> 02:16:11,630
Yes, get on
the boat, Rose.

1705
02:16:14,458 --> 02:16:15,630
Oh my God, look at you.

1706
02:16:15,876 --> 02:16:17,799
You look a fright.

1707
02:16:17,795 --> 02:16:18,796
Here.

1708
02:16:20,547 --> 02:16:22,720
Put this on. Come.

1709
02:16:27,721 --> 02:16:29,564
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1710
02:16:29,807 --> 02:16:31,650
No, not without you.

1711
02:16:31,892 --> 02:16:33,735
I'll be all right.
Listen, I'll be fine.

1712
02:16:34,061 --> 02:16:35,904
I'm a survivor, all right'?
Don't worry about me.

1713
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:37,527
Now, go on.
Get on.

1714
02:16:38,065 --> 02:16:39,692
I have an arrangement with an
officer on the other side of the ship.

1715
02:16:40,150 --> 02:16:41,697
Jack and I can
get off safely.

1716
02:16:42,236 --> 02:16:43,237
Both of us.

1717
02:16:44,405 --> 02:16:45,577
See?

1718
02:16:45,572 --> 02:16:46,619
I got my own
boat to catch.

1719
02:16:47,408 --> 02:16:48,500
Go on, hurry.

1720
02:16:48,492 --> 02:16:49,914
They're almost full.

1721
02:16:51,412 --> 02:16:52,538
- Step aboard, miss
- Go- Go-

1722
02:16:54,415 --> 02:16:55,587
Step aboard, please.

1723
02:16:55,874 --> 02:16:57,376
You're daddy's
good girl, all right?

1724
02:16:57,376 --> 02:16:58,502
You're my little sailor.

1725
02:17:02,756 --> 02:17:03,757
Clear the rail, please

1726
02:17:05,426 --> 02:17:06,678
And, lower away!

1727
02:17:20,524 --> 02:17:21,867
You're a good liar.

1728
02:17:22,609 --> 02:17:24,452
Almost as good as you.

1729
02:17:29,116 --> 02:17:32,791
There's no-- there's no
arrangement, is there?

1730
02:17:34,121 --> 02:17:35,623
No, there is.

1731
02:17:35,956 --> 02:17:38,129
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1732
02:17:40,043 --> 02:17:41,716
I always win, Jack.

1733
02:17:42,796 --> 02:17:44,469
One way or another.

1734
02:18:42,606 --> 02:18:43,653
Rose!

1735
02:18:46,026 --> 02:18:47,027
Stop her!

1736
02:18:47,778 --> 02:18:48,779
Rose, what
are you doing?!

1737
02:18:50,864 --> 02:18:51,865
No!

1738
02:19:14,888 --> 02:19:17,562
Rose! You're so stupid!
Why did you do that, huh?

1739
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:19,893
You're so stupid, Rose.

1740
02:19:21,228 --> 02:19:22,901
Why did you
do that? Why?!

1741
02:19:24,231 --> 02:19:26,233
You jump,
I jump, right'?

1742
02:19:28,068 --> 02:19:29,115
Right.

1743
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:33,373
Oh God.
I couldn't go.

1744
02:19:34,324 --> 02:19:35,917
I couldn't
go, Jack.

1745
02:19:35,909 --> 02:19:37,582
It's all right- We'll
think of something

1746
02:19:39,246 --> 02:19:40,748
- At least I'm with you.
- We'll think of something.

1747
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:56,267
Come on! Move!

1748
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:00,601
Come on!
Move.

1749
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:08,400
Come on!

1750
02:20:16,533 --> 02:20:17,534
Move!

1751
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:25,292
Come on!
Come on Rose.

1752
02:20:27,878 --> 02:20:28,879
Rose, come on!

1753
02:20:31,882 --> 02:20:32,929
Move Rose!

1754
02:20:36,011 --> 02:20:37,012
Go!

1755
02:20:47,606 --> 02:20:50,325
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1756
02:21:04,331 --> 02:21:06,675
What could
possibly be funny?

1757
02:21:08,085 --> 02:21:09,837
I put the diamond
in the coat.

1758
02:21:12,589 --> 02:21:14,512
And I put the
coat on her!

1759
02:21:16,259 --> 02:21:17,351
Come on!

1760
02:21:37,614 --> 02:21:39,036
Dada!

1761
02:21:41,368 --> 02:21:42,494
We can't leave him.

1762
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:48,383
All right, come on!

1763
02:21:50,043 --> 02:21:52,216
Dada!

1764
02:22:05,308 --> 02:22:06,651
Go back!

1765
02:22:17,362 --> 02:22:18,614
It's the wrong way!
Come back!

1766
02:22:18,613 --> 02:22:21,207
No, not that way!
Come back! Stop!

1767
02:22:26,246 --> 02:22:27,418
Go!

1768
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:33,425
Go! Run!

1769
02:22:59,112 --> 02:23:00,113
This way!

1770
02:23:12,292 --> 02:23:13,464
Give me your hand!

1771
02:23:22,469 --> 02:23:23,812
Oh, God!

1772
02:23:28,141 --> 02:23:29,313
Help!

1773
02:23:35,148 --> 02:23:36,491
Help!

1774
02:23:37,943 --> 02:23:39,115
Wait, sir!

1775
02:23:39,111 --> 02:23:40,658
Sir, open the gate, please!

1776
02:23:40,904 --> 02:23:42,076
Help us, please!

1777
02:23:42,322 --> 02:23:43,665
Help us!

1778
02:23:43,657 --> 02:23:44,829
- Please!
- Please!

1779
02:23:46,493 --> 02:23:47,836
Bloody hell!

1780
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:55,502
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

1781
02:23:55,836 --> 02:23:57,179
Go, go!

1782
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:58,421
Jesus.

1783
02:23:59,506 --> 02:24:00,507
- Please!
- Come on!

1784
02:24:00,757 --> 02:24:02,009
Hurry!

1785
02:24:02,884 --> 02:24:03,931
Come on!

1786
02:24:08,515 --> 02:24:10,267
I'm sorry, I
dropped the keys.

1787
02:24:11,518 --> 02:24:13,691
- Vila it, please!
-'Vila it !

1788
02:24:14,020 --> 02:24:16,523
Don't leave! Please,
send for help!

1789
02:24:35,208 --> 02:24:37,210
I got it! Which
one is it, Rose'?

1790
02:24:37,544 --> 02:24:39,546
The short one.
Try the short one.

1791
02:24:40,547 --> 02:24:41,548
Hurry, Jack.

1792
02:24:45,218 --> 02:24:46,891
Oh no! It won't go in

1793
02:24:47,804 --> 02:24:48,805
Hurry, Jack.

1794
02:24:51,391 --> 02:24:53,314
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1795
02:24:54,561 --> 02:24:56,234
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

1796
02:24:57,898 --> 02:24:59,571
- Hurry, Jack!
- Come on!

1797
02:25:02,235 --> 02:25:04,237
I got it! I got it!
Go! Go, Rose!

1798
02:25:05,238 --> 02:25:06,581
Go! Go!

1799
02:25:18,919 --> 02:25:21,263
Jack! Come on!

1800
02:25:23,256 --> 02:25:24,758
Move, move.

1801
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:36,444
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

1802
02:25:41,608 --> 02:25:43,281
Hold it! Hold it!

1803
02:25:43,610 --> 02:25:44,953
Hold it!

1804
02:25:54,871 --> 02:25:59,126
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1805
02:26:11,304 --> 02:26:13,147
Mommy!

1806
02:26:19,813 --> 02:26:20,905
Keep going up!

1807
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:25,652
Stop pushing!

1808
02:26:27,821 --> 02:26:29,164
Stay back!

1809
02:26:29,406 --> 02:26:31,909
V\flll you give us a chance
to live, you limey bastard!

1810
02:26:32,158 --> 02:26:34,832
I'll shoot any man who tries
to get past me! Get back!

1811
02:26:34,828 --> 02:26:35,920
Bastard!

1812
02:26:36,162 --> 02:26:37,835
Get back!

1813
02:26:37,831 --> 02:26:38,923
We had a deal,
damn you!

1814
02:26:42,335 --> 02:26:45,464
Your money can't save you
any more than it could save me.

1815
02:26:45,463 --> 02:26:46,464
Get back!

1816
02:26:47,674 --> 02:26:49,597
Women and children only!

1817
02:26:58,518 --> 02:26:59,861
No, Tommy!

1818
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:19,581
No, Will!

1819
02:27:26,463 --> 02:27:27,965
Now stand
back, damn you!

1820
02:27:31,301 --> 02:27:34,805
Gently, gently. Hold it. Hold it.

1821
02:27:44,481 --> 02:27:46,154
I have a child!

1822
02:27:46,483 --> 02:27:48,611
- I have a child!
- Clear a path here!

1823
02:27:48,985 --> 02:27:50,987
Please, I have a child!

1824
02:27:51,821 --> 02:27:54,495
Please. I'm all she has in the world.

1825
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:56,497
Go on.

1826
02:27:56,826 --> 02:27:57,827
Step back!

1827
02:27:58,328 --> 02:27:59,671
- Please?
- Here, give her to me

1828
02:28:00,372 --> 02:28:01,794
You're all right, dearie.

1829
02:28:04,876 --> 02:28:05,968
Give her here.

1830
02:28:07,879 --> 02:28:08,880
There, there.

1831
02:28:13,176 --> 02:28:16,020
Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Andrews!

1832
02:28:18,515 --> 02:28:19,516
Oh, Rose.

1833
02:28:22,519 --> 02:28:23,862
Won't you even
make a try for it?

1834
02:28:25,855 --> 02:28:30,361
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1835
02:28:32,195 --> 02:28:34,539
It's going fast.
We have to move.

1836
02:28:34,823 --> 02:28:35,824
Wail.

1837
02:28:38,868 --> 02:28:40,336
Good luck to you, Rose.

1838
02:28:42,372 --> 02:28:43,373
And to you.

1839
02:28:56,344 --> 02:28:57,391
Mr. Guggenheim?

1840
02:28:57,846 --> 02:28:59,018
These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

1841
02:28:59,222 --> 02:29:00,394
No, thank you.

1842
02:29:00,390 --> 02:29:04,270
We are dressed in our best and are
prepared to go down as gentlemen.

1843
02:29:05,061 --> 02:29:07,029
But we would
like a brandy.

1844
02:29:07,730 --> 02:29:10,233
Get the falls over here now!

1845
02:29:10,900 --> 02:29:13,369
Let them drop. Then we'll right it.

1846
02:29:18,616 --> 02:29:19,742
<i>Capitén?</i>

1847
02:29:20,243 --> 02:29:22,587
Capitén, where should I go? Please.

1848
02:29:29,919 --> 02:29:31,921
Captain. Captain. Sir.

1849
02:30:02,410 --> 02:30:04,629
Right'
That's it, then.

1850
02:30:05,455 --> 02:30:07,082
Good-bye, Wally.
Good luck.

1851
02:30:08,124 --> 02:30:09,296
- Good-bye, Wallace.
- Sn long, old chap.

1852
02:31:24,534 --> 02:31:29,040
And so they lived happily
together for 300 years...

1853
02:31:29,372 --> 02:31:31,545
...in the land of Tir na nog...

1854
02:31:32,542 --> 02:31:35,216
Land of eternal
youth and beauty.

1855
02:32:10,580 --> 02:32:12,082
There's no time!

1856
02:32:12,081 --> 02:32:13,458
Cut those falls!

1857
02:32:13,708 --> 02:32:15,881
Out them!
Cut them if you have to!

1858
02:32:16,586 --> 02:32:19,260
I need a knife!

1859
02:32:20,923 --> 02:32:22,596
Cut the falls now!

1860
02:32:23,217 --> 02:32:24,594
Cut them loose!

1861
02:32:35,104 --> 02:32:36,947
Cut those bloody falls!

1862
02:33:24,612 --> 02:33:25,955
Gentlemen...

1863
02:33:26,447 --> 02:33:29,121
...it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1864
02:34:29,927 --> 02:34:31,975
We have to stay on the
ship as long as possible.

1865
02:34:31,971 --> 02:34:32,972
Come on!

1866
02:34:45,026 --> 02:34:46,699
This way.
Through the rail.

1867
02:34:48,946 --> 02:34:50,289
Come on, Rose.

1868
02:34:50,615 --> 02:34:51,616
Jump.

1869
02:34:53,951 --> 02:34:55,043
Come on.

1870
02:35:28,319 --> 02:35:29,912
<i>L</i> 90! you.
Jump_

1871
02:35:32,573 --> 02:35:34,416
I've got you, miss.

1872
02:35:38,246 --> 02:35:39,418
Back!

1873
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:11,283
No! You'll swamp us!

1874
02:36:24,041 --> 02:36:27,136
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death--

1875
02:36:27,461 --> 02:36:30,214
You wanna walk a little faster
through that valley there?

1876
02:37:20,514 --> 02:37:22,187
Holy Mary, mother of God...

1877
02:37:22,183 --> 02:37:25,153
...pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

1878
02:37:25,853 --> 02:37:27,025
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1879
02:37:27,021 --> 02:37:28,113
This way.

1880
02:37:38,449 --> 02:37:40,543
Come on!

1881
02:37:50,211 --> 02:37:52,634
And I saw a new heaven
and a new earth...

1882
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:56,384
...for the first heaven and the first earth
had passed away...

1883
02:37:57,468 --> 02:37:59,061
...and there was no more sea.

1884
02:38:05,559 --> 02:38:08,654
It'll be over soon.
It'll all be over soon.

1885
02:38:14,235 --> 02:38:15,908
And He shall dwell with them.

1886
02:38:15,903 --> 02:38:20,329
And they shall be His people
and God Himself shall be with them...

1887
02:38:20,658 --> 02:38:22,080
...and be their God.

1888
02:38:22,827 --> 02:38:23,919
Jack...

1889
02:38:24,912 --> 02:38:26,914
'..this is where
we first met.

1890
02:38:33,963 --> 02:38:37,183
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes...

1891
02:38:37,508 --> 02:38:39,602
wand there shall be
no more death.

1892
02:38:40,094 --> 02:38:42,597
Neither shall there be
sorrow or crying-

1893
02:38:43,097 --> 02:38:45,600
Neither shall there
be any more pain...

1894
02:38:46,434 --> 02:38:49,187
...for the former world
has passed away.

1895
02:39:03,617 --> 02:39:05,961
Bloody pull faster!
And pull!

1896
02:39:29,226 --> 02:39:30,569
Hang on, miss Trudy!

1897
02:40:06,514 --> 02:40:08,016
Hold on real tight.

1898
02:40:25,533 --> 02:40:27,376
God Almighty.

1899
02:40:34,834 --> 02:40:37,383
Keep those breakers in!
Keep them in!

1900
02:41:56,373 --> 02:41:57,795
We have to move!

1901
02:42:03,714 --> 02:42:05,136
Give me your hand.
I'll pull you over.

1902
02:42:05,132 --> 02:42:06,258
I can't.

1903
02:42:06,258 --> 02:42:07,350
Come on!

1904
02:42:07,343 --> 02:42:08,390
Give me your hand.

1905
02:42:10,137 --> 02:42:12,139
I've got you.
I won't let go.

1906
02:42:12,723 --> 02:42:13,770
Come on,
I've got you.

1907
02:42:24,985 --> 02:42:28,159
- What's happening, Jack'?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1908
02:42:37,331 --> 02:42:38,332
Hold on.

1909
02:43:20,708 --> 02:43:21,880
This is it!

1910
02:43:33,887 --> 02:43:37,562
Oh, my God, Jack!
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1911
02:43:38,225 --> 02:43:39,568
Hold on!

1912
02:43:54,575 --> 02:43:56,577
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1913
02:43:56,577 --> 02:43:58,796
Take a deep
breath when I say.

1914
02:44:04,418 --> 02:44:06,637
Kick for the surface
and keep kicking.

1915
02:44:06,628 --> 02:44:07,971
Do not let go
of my hand.

1916
02:44:15,679 --> 02:44:16,976
We're going to make it, Rose.

1917
02:44:16,972 --> 02:44:18,098
Trust me.

1918
02:44:18,098 --> 02:44:19,350
I trust you.

1919
02:44:24,438 --> 02:44:26,440
Ready! Ready!

1920
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:27,941
NOW!

1921
02:45:04,311 --> 02:45:06,154
Jack! Jack!

1922
02:45:49,189 --> 02:45:50,190
Rose!

1923
02:45:50,691 --> 02:45:53,035
Get off her!
Get off her!

1924
02:45:57,239 --> 02:45:58,912
Swim, Rose! I need
you to swim!

1925
02:46:03,704 --> 02:46:05,377
Keep swimming.

1926
02:46:09,042 --> 02:46:10,385
It's so cold.

1927
02:46:10,627 --> 02:46:11,970
Swim, Rose!

1928
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:17,893
Come on.

1929
02:46:19,887 --> 02:46:20,979
Keep swimming.

1930
02:46:21,221 --> 02:46:22,564
Come on.

1931
02:46:24,516 --> 02:46:25,688
Here...

1932
02:46:25,684 --> 02:46:26,856
.,.get on it.

1933
02:46:27,561 --> 02:46:29,063
Get on top.

1934
02:46:36,445 --> 02:46:37,913
Come on, Rose.

1935
02:46:47,456 --> 02:46:49,129
Stay on it.
Stay on, Rose.

1936
02:47:10,979 --> 02:47:12,481
It'll be all right now.

1937
02:47:14,983 --> 02:47:16,485
It'll be all right now.

1938
02:47:23,825 --> 02:47:24,997
Retum...

1939
02:47:25,202 --> 02:47:26,875
...the boats!

1940
02:47:30,999 --> 02:47:33,127
The boats are coming
back for us Rose.

1941
02:47:33,669 --> 02:47:35,137
Hold on just a
little bit longer-

1942
02:47:36,004 --> 02:47:38,678
They had to row
away for the suction...

1943
02:47:38,882 --> 02:47:40,976
...but now they'll
be coming back.

1944
02:47:44,012 --> 02:47:45,355
For God's sake!

1945
02:47:45,639 --> 02:47:46,856
Please...

1946
02:47:47,182 --> 02:47:48,479
...help us!

1947
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:55,573
You don't understand.

1948
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:58,573
If we go back, they'll
swamp the boat.

1949
02:47:58,819 --> 02:48:00,162
They'll pull us right down,
I'm telling you.

1950
02:48:00,696 --> 02:48:03,199
Oh, knock it off.
You're scaring me.

1951
02:48:03,532 --> 02:48:06,035
Come on, girls, grab
an oar. Let's go.

1952
02:48:06,326 --> 02:48:09,500
Are you out of your mind?
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

1953
02:48:09,705 --> 02:48:13,050
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?!

1954
02:48:20,007 --> 02:48:22,226
I don't understand a one of you.

1955
02:48:24,052 --> 02:48:25,178
What's the matter with you'?

1956
02:48:26,179 --> 02:48:27,601
It's your men out there!

1957
02:48:30,058 --> 02:48:31,731
There's plenty of room for more.

1958
02:48:32,019 --> 02:48:33,692
And there'll be one less
on this boat...

1959
02:48:34,021 --> 02:48:37,400
...if you don't shut that
hole in your face!

1960
02:48:53,248 --> 02:48:57,378
Now, bring in your oars over there-
And tie these boats together as well

1961
02:49:01,757 --> 02:49:04,101
Now, make sure that's
tied up nice and tight.

1962
02:49:07,596 --> 02:49:10,270
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

1963
02:49:10,599 --> 02:49:14,229
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now...

1964
02:49:14,227 --> 02:49:15,444
was quick as you can, please.

1965
02:49:15,437 --> 02:49:17,940
Let's create some space over there
Move forward and aft-

1966
02:49:27,949 --> 02:49:29,792
It's getting quiet.

1967
02:49:31,953 --> 02:49:35,298
It's just going to take a
couple of minutes...

1968
02:49:35,791 --> 02:49:37,793
...to get the boats organized.

1969
02:49:40,629 --> 02:49:42,302
I don't know about you but...

1970
02:49:42,631 --> 02:49:46,135
...I intend to write
a strongly worded letter...

1971
02:49:46,468 --> 02:49:48,095
...to the White Star Line
about all this.

1972
02:49:56,478 --> 02:49:58,151
I love you, Jack.

1973
02:50:04,820 --> 02:50:06,322
Don't you do that.

1974
02:50:07,823 --> 02:50:10,997
Don't you say your
good-byes. Not yet.

1975
02:50:11,326 --> 02:50:12,828
Do you understand me'?

1976
02:50:13,161 --> 02:50:15,004
I'm so cold.

1977
02:50:15,497 --> 02:50:16,999
Listen, Rose...

1978
02:50:18,166 --> 02:50:19,839
...you're gonna
get out of here.

1979
02:50:21,002 --> 02:50:22,504
You're gonna go on...

1980
02:50:23,839 --> 02:50:25,637
...and you're gonna
make lots of babies.

1981
02:50:26,341 --> 02:50:28,343
And you're gonna
watch them grow.

1982
02:50:30,011 --> 02:50:31,308
You're gonna die an old...

1983
02:50:31,304 --> 02:50:32,556
man old lady.

1984
02:50:32,848 --> 02:50:34,521
...Warm in her bed.

1985
02:50:36,184 --> 02:50:37,310
Not here.

1986
02:50:38,186 --> 02:50:40,689
Not this night.
Not like this.

1987
02:50:41,022 --> 02:50:42,695
Do you understand me'?

1988
02:50:45,694 --> 02:50:47,867
I can't feel my body.

1989
02:50:49,531 --> 02:50:51,158
V\finning that ticket, Rose...

1990
02:50:51,158 --> 02:50:53,752
...was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

1991
02:50:55,370 --> 02:50:57,213
It brought me to you.

1992
02:50:58,832 --> 02:51:01,301
And I'm thankful
for that, Rose.

1993
02:51:01,835 --> 02:51:03,178
I'm thankful.

1994
02:51:06,631 --> 02:51:07,723
You must...

1995
02:51:08,842 --> 02:51:10,844
...you must do me
this honor.

1996
02:51:13,847 --> 02:51:17,351
You must promise me
that you'll survive.

1997
02:51:19,352 --> 02:51:21,025
That you won't give up...

1998
02:51:22,189 --> 02:51:24,191
...no matter what happens.

1999
02:51:26,860 --> 02:51:29,204
No matter how hopeless.

2000
02:51:32,365 --> 02:51:34,538
Promise me now, Rose.

2001
02:51:36,703 --> 02:51:39,047
And never let go
of that promise.

2002
02:51:40,707 --> 02:51:42,050
I promise.

2003
02:51:44,169 --> 02:51:45,842
Never let go.

2004
02:51:48,715 --> 02:51:50,843
I'll never let go, Jack.

2005
02:51:53,553 --> 02:51:55,226
I'll never let go.

2006
02:52:19,329 --> 02:52:20,831
Right ahead, sir.

2007
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,502
Oars!

2008
02:52:26,002 --> 02:52:27,675
Do you see any moving?

2009
02:52:28,672 --> 02:52:30,595
No, sir. None
moving, sir.

2010
02:52:31,174 --> 02:52:32,517
Check them.

2011
02:52:32,843 --> 02:52:34,345
Bring that oar up here.

2012
02:52:41,017 --> 02:52:42,018
Check them.
Make sure.

2013
02:52:43,436 --> 02:52:45,063
These are dead, sir.

2014
02:52:45,564 --> 02:52:46,736
Now, give way.

2015
02:52:47,190 --> 02:52:48,237
Ahead easy.

2016
02:52:55,031 --> 02:52:56,533
Careful with your oars.

2017
02:52:57,117 --> 02:52:58,164
Don't hit them

2018
02:53:00,704 --> 02:53:03,048
ls there anyone
alive out there?

2019
02:53:04,541 --> 02:53:06,384
Can anyone hear me?

2020
02:53:08,545 --> 02:53:10,889
Is there anyone
alive out there?

2021
02:53:17,721 --> 02:53:18,938
We waited too long.

2022
02:53:22,851 --> 02:53:24,728
Well, keep checking them!

2023
02:53:24,728 --> 02:53:26,401
Keep looking!

2024
02:53:27,230 --> 02:53:29,733
Is there anyone
alive out there?

2025
02:53:33,236 --> 02:53:35,238
Can anyone hear me?

2026
02:53:46,416 --> 02:53:49,260
Come, Josephine...

2027
02:53:49,753 --> 02:53:54,259
<i>...in my flying machine</i>

2028
02:53:55,759 --> 02:53:58,979
<i>And it's up she goes</i>

2029
02:54:00,931 --> 02:54:02,933
<i>Up she goes</i>

2030
02:54:08,438 --> 02:54:10,611
Come, Josephine...

2031
02:54:12,943 --> 02:54:15,287
<i>---in my flying--~</i>

2032
02:54:39,135 --> 02:54:40,478
Jack.

2033
02:54:58,321 --> 02:54:59,664
Jack.

2034
02:55:00,156 --> 02:55:01,499
There's a boat.

2035
02:55:14,671 --> 02:55:16,014
Jack.

2036
02:55:28,518 --> 02:55:30,520
There's a
boat, Jack.

2037
02:56:14,230 --> 02:56:15,573
Come back.

2038
02:56:16,733 --> 02:56:18,235
Come back.

2039
02:56:20,403 --> 02:56:21,746
Come back.

2040
02:56:22,906 --> 02:56:24,408
Come back.

2041
02:56:25,241 --> 02:56:26,743
Come back.

2042
02:56:27,577 --> 02:56:29,921
Come back.
Come back!

2043
02:56:31,414 --> 02:56:32,916
Hello!

2044
02:56:35,043 --> 02:56:36,920
Can anyone hear me?

2045
02:56:37,420 --> 02:56:39,093
There's nothing
here, sir.

2046
02:56:41,591 --> 02:56:42,934
Come back.

2047
02:56:44,427 --> 02:56:45,770
Come back.

2048
02:56:53,603 --> 02:56:55,105
I'll never let go.

2049
02:56:55,355 --> 02:56:56,698
I promise.

2050
02:57:39,774 --> 02:57:41,617
Come about!

2051
02:58:02,964 --> 02:58:06,810
Fifteen hundred people
went into the sea...

2052
02:58:07,135 --> 02:58:10,139
...when Titanic
sank from under us.

2053
02:58:11,973 --> 02:58:15,147
There were twenty
boats ﬂoating nearby...

2054
02:58:16,311 --> 02:58:18,655
...and only one came back.

2055
02:58:20,481 --> 02:58:21,607
One.

2056
02:58:23,318 --> 02:58:25,992
Six were saved
from the water...

2057
02:58:26,487 --> 02:58:28,160
...myself included.

2058
02:58:29,324 --> 02:58:30,621
Six...

2059
02:58:31,826 --> 02:58:33,703
...out of fifteen hundred.

2060
02:58:36,998 --> 02:58:38,341
Aﬂerward...

2061
02:58:39,500 --> 02:58:41,502
...the seven hundred
people in the boats...

2062
02:58:42,295 --> 02:58:44,389
-..had nothing to
do but wait-

2063
02:58:46,007 --> 02:58:47,680
Wait to die.

2064
02:58:48,176 --> 02:58:49,678
Wait to live.

2065
02:58:50,845 --> 02:58:53,018
Wait for an absolution...

2066
02:58:53,514 --> 02:58:55,357
<i>...that would never come.</i>

2067
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:02,208
Sir, I don't think you'll find any
of your people down here.

2068
03:00:02,208 --> 03:00:03,630
It's all steerage.

2069
03:00:06,587 --> 03:00:10,262
His hair is reddish brown,
reddish brown, reddish brown.

2070
03:00:10,258 --> 03:00:11,635
White beard.

2071
03:00:12,093 --> 03:00:13,766
Isn't there another
passenger list?

2072
03:00:13,761 --> 03:00:15,058
There is no other list.

2073
03:00:15,054 --> 03:00:16,476
Perhaps he's on
another ship.

2074
03:00:16,764 --> 03:00:18,607
We're doing all we can,
ma'am. I'm so sorry.

2075
03:00:41,956 --> 03:00:44,630
<i>That's the last time
I ever saw him.</i>

2076
03:00:45,126 --> 03:00:48,630
<i>He man'ied, of course,
and inherited his millions.</i>

2077
03:00:49,297 --> 03:00:52,801
<i>But the Crash of '29 hit his interests hard...</i>

2078
03:00:53,134 --> 03:00:55,432
<i>...and he put a pistol in
his mouth that year.</i>

2079
03:00:55,970 --> 03:00:57,813
Or so I read.

2080
03:01:10,651 --> 03:01:12,119
Can I take your name
please, love?

2081
03:01:15,156 --> 03:01:16,499
Dawson.

2082
03:01:18,659 --> 03:01:20,161
Rose Dawson.

2083
03:01:21,496 --> 03:01:22,668
Thank you.

2084
03:01:29,670 --> 03:01:31,968
We never found
anything on Jack.

2085
03:01:31,964 --> 03:01:33,887
There's no record
of him at all.

2086
03:01:34,509 --> 03:01:36,853
No, there wouldn't
be, would there?

2087
03:01:37,178 --> 03:01:39,897
And I've never spoken
of him until now.

2088
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:41,687
Not to anyone.

2089
03:01:42,850 --> 03:01:44,852
Not even your
grandfather.

2090
03:01:45,186 --> 03:01:49,191
A woman's heart is a
deep ocean of secrets.

2091
03:01:50,024 --> 03:01:53,699
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson...

2092
03:01:54,028 --> 03:01:56,030
...and that he saved me...

2093
03:01:56,364 --> 03:01:59,709
...in every way that
a person can be saved.

2094
03:02:01,702 --> 03:02:04,376
I don't even have
a picture of him.

2095
03:02:06,874 --> 03:02:10,720
He exists now only
in my memory.

2096
03:02:15,550 --> 03:02:19,054
<i>Keldysh, Mir 2 on our
way to the surface.</i>

2097
03:02:35,570 --> 03:02:38,369
<i>I was saving this for when
I found the diamond.</i>

2098
03:02:47,748 --> 03:02:49,250
I'm sorry.

2099
03:02:51,919 --> 03:02:53,421
Three years...

2100
03:02:54,088 --> 03:02:56,762
___l've thought of
nothing except Titanic.

2101
03:02:57,592 --> 03:02:59,435
But I never got it.

2102
03:03:02,555 --> 03:03:04,432
I never let it in.
